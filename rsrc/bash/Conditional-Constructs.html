<span id="Conditional-Constructs-1"></span><h4 class="subsubsection">3.2.5.2 Conditional Constructs</h4>
<span id="index-commands_002c-conditional"></span>

<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>if</code></dt>
<dd><span id="index-if"></span>
<span id="index-then"></span>
<span id="index-else"></span>
<span id="index-elif"></span>
<span id="index-fi"></span>
<p>The syntax of the <code>if</code> command is:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">if <var>test-commands</var>; then
  <var>consequent-commands</var>;
[elif <var>more-test-commands</var>; then
  <var>more-consequents</var>;]
[else <var>alternate-consequents</var>;]
fi
</pre></div>

<p>The <var>test-commands</var> list is executed, and if its return status is zero,
the <var>consequent-commands</var> list is executed.
If <var>test-commands</var> returns a non-zero status, each <code>elif</code> list
is executed in turn, and if its exit status is zero,
the corresponding <var>more-consequents</var> is executed and the   
command completes.
If &lsquo;<samp>else <var>alternate-consequents</var></samp>&rsquo; is present, and
the final command in the final <code>if</code> or <code>elif</code> clause
has a non-zero exit status, then <var>alternate-consequents</var> is executed.
The return status is the exit status of the last command executed, or
zero if no condition tested true.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>case</code></dt>
<dd><span id="index-case"></span>
<span id="index-in"></span>
<span id="index-esac"></span>
<p>The syntax of the <code>case</code> command is:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">case <var>word</var> in
    [ [(] <var>pattern</var> [| <var>pattern</var>]&hellip;) <var>command-list</var> ;;]&hellip;
esac
</pre></div>

<p><code>case</code> will selectively execute the <var>command-list</var> corresponding to
the first <var>pattern</var> that matches <var>word</var>.
The match is performed according
to the rules described below in <a href="Pattern-Matching.html">Pattern Matching</a>.
If the <code>nocasematch</code> shell option
(see the description of <code>shopt</code> in <a href="The-Shopt-Builtin.html">The Shopt Builtin</a>)
is enabled, the match is performed without regard to the case
of alphabetic characters.
The &lsquo;<samp>|</samp>&rsquo; is used to separate multiple patterns, and the &lsquo;<samp>)</samp>&rsquo;
operator terminates a pattern list.
A list of patterns and an associated command-list is known
as a <var>clause</var>.
</p>
<p>Each clause must be terminated with &lsquo;<samp>;;</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>;&amp;</samp>&rsquo;, or &lsquo;<samp>;;&amp;</samp>&rsquo;.
The <var>word</var> undergoes tilde expansion, parameter expansion, command
substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal
(see <a href="Shell-Parameter-Expansion.html">Shell Parameter Expansion</a>)
before matching is
attempted.  Each <var>pattern</var> undergoes tilde expansion, parameter
expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion.
</p>
<p>There may be an arbitrary number of <code>case</code> clauses, each terminated
by a &lsquo;<samp>;;</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>;&amp;</samp>&rsquo;, or &lsquo;<samp>;;&amp;</samp>&rsquo;.
The first pattern that matches determines the
command-list that is executed.
It&rsquo;s a common idiom to use &lsquo;<samp>*</samp>&rsquo; as the final pattern to define the
default case, since that pattern will always match.
</p>
<p>Here is an example using <code>case</code> in a script that could be used to
describe one interesting feature of an animal:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">echo -n &quot;Enter the name of an animal: &quot;
read ANIMAL
echo -n &quot;The $ANIMAL has &quot;
case $ANIMAL in
  horse | dog | cat) echo -n &quot;four&quot;;;
  man | kangaroo ) echo -n &quot;two&quot;;;
  *) echo -n &quot;an unknown number of&quot;;;
esac
echo &quot; legs.&quot;
</pre></div>


<p>If the &lsquo;<samp>;;</samp>&rsquo; operator is used, no subsequent matches are attempted after
the first pattern match.
Using &lsquo;<samp>;&amp;</samp>&rsquo;  in place of &lsquo;<samp>;;</samp>&rsquo; causes execution to continue with
the <var>command-list</var> associated with the next clause, if any.
Using &lsquo;<samp>;;&amp;</samp>&rsquo; in place of &lsquo;<samp>;;</samp>&rsquo; causes the shell to test the patterns
in the next clause, if any, and execute any associated <var>command-list</var>
on a successful match,
continuing the case statement execution as if the pattern list had not matched.
</p>
<p>The return status is zero if no <var>pattern</var> is matched.  Otherwise, the
return status is the exit status of the <var>command-list</var> executed.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>select</code></dt>
<dd><span id="index-select"></span>

<p>The <code>select</code> construct allows the easy generation of menus.
It has almost the same syntax as the <code>for</code> command:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">select <var>name</var> [in <var>words</var> &hellip;]; do <var>commands</var>; done
</pre></div>

<p>The list of words following <code>in</code> is expanded, generating a list
of items.  The set of expanded words is printed on the standard
error output stream, each preceded by a number.  If the
&lsquo;<samp>in <var>words</var></samp>&rsquo; is omitted, the positional parameters are printed,
as if &lsquo;<samp>in &quot;$@&quot;</samp>&rsquo; had been specified.
The <code>PS3</code> prompt is then displayed and a line is read from the
standard input.
If the line consists of a number corresponding to one of the displayed
words, then the value of <var>name</var> is set to that word.
If the line is empty, the words and prompt are displayed again.
If <code>EOF</code> is read, the <code>select</code> command completes.
Any other value read causes <var>name</var> to be set to null.
The line read is saved in the variable <code>REPLY</code>.
</p>
<p>The <var>commands</var> are executed after each selection until a
<code>break</code> command is executed, at which
point the <code>select</code> command completes.
</p>
<p>Here is an example that allows the user to pick a filename from the
current directory, and displays the name and index of the file
selected.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">select fname in *;
do
	echo you picked $fname \($REPLY\)
	break;
done
</pre></div>

</dd>
<dt><code>((&hellip;))</code></dt>
<dd><div class="example">
<pre class="example">(( <var>expression</var> ))
</pre></div>

<p>The arithmetic <var>expression</var> is evaluated according to the rules
described below (see <a href="Shell-Arithmetic.html">Shell Arithmetic</a>).
If the value of the expression is non-zero, the return status is 0;
otherwise the return status is 1.  This is exactly equivalent to
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">let &quot;<var>expression</var>&quot;
</pre></div>
<p>See <a href="Bash-Builtins.html">Bash Builtins</a>, for a full description of the <code>let</code> builtin.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>[[&hellip;]]</code></dt>
<dd><span id="index-_005b_005b"></span>
<span id="index-_005d_005d"></span>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">[[ <var>expression</var> ]]
</pre></div>

<p>Return a status of 0 or 1 depending on the evaluation of
the conditional expression <var>expression</var>.
Expressions are composed of the primaries described below in
<a href="Bash-Conditional-Expressions.html">Bash Conditional Expressions</a>.
Word splitting and filename expansion are not performed on the words
between the <code>[[</code> and <code>]]</code>; tilde expansion, parameter and
variable expansion, arithmetic expansion, command substitution, process
substitution, and quote removal are performed.
Conditional operators such as &lsquo;<samp>-f</samp>&rsquo; must be unquoted to be recognized
as primaries.
</p>
<p>When used with <code>[[</code>, the &lsquo;<samp>&lt;</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>&gt;</samp>&rsquo; operators sort
lexicographically using the current locale.
</p>
<p>When the &lsquo;<samp>==</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>!=</samp>&rsquo; operators are used, the string to the
right of the operator is considered a pattern and matched according
to the rules described below in <a href="Pattern-Matching.html">Pattern Matching</a>,
as if the <code>extglob</code> shell option were enabled.
The &lsquo;<samp>=</samp>&rsquo; operator is identical to &lsquo;<samp>==</samp>&rsquo;.
If the <code>nocasematch</code> shell option
(see the description of <code>shopt</code> in <a href="The-Shopt-Builtin.html">The Shopt Builtin</a>)
is enabled, the match is performed without regard to the case
of alphabetic characters.
The return value is 0 if the string matches (&lsquo;<samp>==</samp>&rsquo;) or does not
match (&lsquo;<samp>!=</samp>&rsquo;) the pattern, and 1 otherwise.
Any part of the pattern may be quoted to force the quoted portion
to be matched as a string.
</p>
<p>An additional binary operator, &lsquo;<samp>=~</samp>&rsquo;, is available, with the same
precedence as &lsquo;<samp>==</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>!=</samp>&rsquo;.
When it is used, the string to the right of the operator is considered
a <small>POSIX</small> extended regular expression and matched accordingly
(using the <small>POSIX</small> <code>regcomp</code> and <code>regexec</code> interfaces
usually described in <i>regex</i>(3)).
The return value is 0 if the string matches
the pattern, and 1 otherwise.
If the regular expression is syntactically incorrect, the conditional
expression&rsquo;s return value is 2.
If the <code>nocasematch</code> shell option
(see the description of <code>shopt</code> in <a href="The-Shopt-Builtin.html">The Shopt Builtin</a>)
is enabled, the match is performed without regard to the case
of alphabetic characters.
Any part of the pattern may be quoted to force the quoted portion
to be matched as a string.
Bracket expressions in regular expressions must be treated carefully,
since normal quoting characters lose their meanings between brackets.
If the pattern is stored in a shell variable, quoting the variable
expansion forces the entire pattern to be matched as a string.
</p>
<p>The pattern will match if it matches any part of the string.
Anchor the pattern using the &lsquo;<samp>^</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>$</samp>&rsquo; regular expression
operators to force it to match the entire string.
The array variable <code>BASH_REMATCH</code> records which parts of the string
matched the pattern.
The element of <code>BASH_REMATCH</code> with index 0 contains the portion of
the string matching the entire regular expression.
Substrings matched by parenthesized subexpressions within the regular
expression are saved in the remaining <code>BASH_REMATCH</code> indices.
The element of <code>BASH_REMATCH</code> with index <var>n</var> is the portion of the
string matching the <var>n</var>th parenthesized subexpression.
</p>
<p>For example, the following will match a line
(stored in the shell variable <var>line</var>)
if there is a sequence of characters anywhere in the value consisting of
any number, including zero, of 
characters in the <code>space</code> character class,
zero or one instances of &lsquo;<samp>a</samp>&rsquo;, then a &lsquo;<samp>b</samp>&rsquo;:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">[[ $line =~ [[:space:]]*(a)?b ]]
</pre></div>

<p>That means values like &lsquo;<samp>aab</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>  aaaaaab</samp>&rsquo; will match, as
will a line containing a &lsquo;<samp>b</samp>&rsquo; anywhere in its value.
</p>
<p>Storing the regular expression in a shell variable is often a useful
way to avoid problems with quoting characters that are special to the
shell.
It is sometimes difficult to specify a regular expression literally
without using quotes, or to keep track of the quoting used by regular
expressions while paying attention to the shell&rsquo;s quote removal.
Using a shell variable to store the pattern decreases these problems.
For example, the following is equivalent to the above:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">pattern='[[:space:]]*(a)?b'
[[ $line =~ $pattern ]]
</pre></div>

<p>If you want to match a character that&rsquo;s special to the regular expression
grammar, it has to be quoted to remove its special meaning.
This means that in the pattern &lsquo;<samp>xxx.txt</samp>&rsquo;, the &lsquo;<samp>.</samp>&rsquo; matches any
character in the string (its usual regular expression meaning), but in the
pattern &lsquo;<samp>&quot;xxx.txt&quot;</samp>&rsquo; it can only match a literal &lsquo;<samp>.</samp>&rsquo;.
Shell programmers should take special care with backslashes, since backslashes
are used both by the shell and regular expressions to remove the special
meaning from the following character.
The following two sets of commands are <em>not</em> equivalent:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">pattern='\.'

[[ . =~ $pattern ]]
[[ . =~ \. ]]

[[ . =~ &quot;$pattern&quot; ]]
[[ . =~ '\.' ]]
</pre></div>

<p>The first two matches will succeed, but the second two will not, because
in the second two the backslash will be part of the pattern to be matched.
In the first two examples, the backslash removes the special meaning from
&lsquo;<samp>.</samp>&rsquo;, so the literal &lsquo;<samp>.</samp>&rsquo; matches.
If the string in the first examples were anything other than &lsquo;<samp>.</samp>&rsquo;, say
&lsquo;<samp>a</samp>&rsquo;, the pattern would not match, because the quoted &lsquo;<samp>.</samp>&rsquo; in the
pattern loses its special meaning of matching any single character.
</p>
<p>Expressions may be combined using the following operators, listed
in decreasing order of precedence:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>( <var>expression</var> )</code></dt>
<dd><p>Returns the value of <var>expression</var>.
This may be used to override the normal precedence of operators.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>! <var>expression</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>True if <var>expression</var> is false.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code><var>expression1</var> &amp;&amp; <var>expression2</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>True if both <var>expression1</var> and <var>expression2</var> are true.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code><var>expression1</var> || <var>expression2</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>True if either <var>expression1</var> or <var>expression2</var> is true.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>The <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>||</code> operators do not evaluate <var>expression2</var> if the
value of <var>expression1</var> is sufficient to determine the return
value of the entire conditional expression.
</p></dd>
</dl>
