    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch15_s02_p01">There is an important difference between trade that flows, say, from one city to another and trade that flows from one nation to another. Unless they share a common currency, as some of the nations of the European Union do, trade among nations requires that currencies be exchanged as well as goods and services. Suppose, for example, that buyers in Mexico purchase silk produced in China. The Mexican buyers will pay in Mexico’s currency, the peso; the manufacturers of the silk must be paid in China’s currency, the yuan. The flow of trade between Mexico and China thus requires an exchange of pesos for yuan.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch15_s02_p02">This section examines the relationship between spending that flows into a country and spending that flows out of it. These spending flows include not only spending for a nation’s exports and imports, but payments to owners of assets in other countries, international transfer payments, and purchases of foreign assets. The balance between spending flowing into a country and spending flowing out of it is called its <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">balance of payments</a><span class="glossdef">The balance between spending flowing into a country and spending flowing out.</span></span>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch15_s02_p03">We will simplify our analysis by ignoring international transfer payments, which occur when an individual, firm, or government makes a gift to an individual, firm, or government in another country. Foreign aid is an example of an international transfer payment. International transfer payments play a relatively minor role in the international financial transactions of most countries; ignoring them will not change our basic conclusions.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch15_s02_p04">A second simplification will be to treat payments to foreign owners of factors of production used in a country as imports and payments received by owners of factors of production used in other countries as exports. This is the approach when we use GNP rather than GDP as the measure of a country’s output.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch15_s02_p05">These two simplifications leave two reasons for demanding a country’s currency: for foreigners to purchase a country’s goods and services (that is, its exports) and to purchase assets in the country. A country’s currency is supplied in order to purchase foreign currencies. A country’s currency is thus supplied for two reasons: to purchase goods and services from other countries (that is, its imports) and to purchase assets in other countries.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch15_s02_p06">We studied the determination of exchange rates in the chapter on how financial markets work. We saw that, in general, exchange rates are determined by demand and supply and that the markets for the currencies of most nations can be regarded as being in equilibrium. Exchange rates adjust quickly, so that the quantity of a currency demanded equals the quantity of the currency supplied.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch15_s02_p07">Our analysis will deal with flows of spending between the domestic economy and the rest of the world. Suppose, for example, that we are analyzing Japan’s economy and its transactions with the rest of the world. The purchase by a buyer in, say, Germany of bonds issued by a Japanese corporation would be part of the rest-of-world demand for yen to buy Japanese assets. Adding export demand to asset demand by people, firms, and governments outside a country, we get the total demand for a country’s currency.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch15_s02_p08">A domestic economy’s currency is supplied to purchase currencies in the rest of the world. In an analysis of the market for Japanese yen, for example, yen are supplied when people, firms, and government agencies in Japan purchase goods and services from the rest of the world. This part of the supply of yen equals Japanese imports. Yen are also supplied so that holders of yen can acquire assets from other countries.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch15_s02_p09">Equilibrium in the market for a country’s currency implies that the quantity of a particular country’s currency demanded equals the quantity supplied. Equilibrium thus implies that</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch15_s02_s01_p04">The left side of the equation is net exports. It is the balance between spending flowing from foreign countries into a particular country for the purchase of its goods and services and spending flowing out of the country for the purchase of goods and services produced in other countries. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">current account</a><span class="glossdef">An accounting statement that includes all spending flows across a nation’s border except those that represent purchases of assets.</span></span> is an accounting statement that includes all spending flows across a nation’s border except those that represent purchases of assets. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">balance on current account</a><span class="glossdef">Spending flowing into an economy from the rest of the world on current account less spending flowing from the nation to the rest of the world on current account.</span></span> equals spending flowing into an economy from the rest of the world on current account less spending flowing from the nation to the rest of the world on current account. Given our two simplifying assumptions—that there are no international transfer payments and that we can treat rest-of-world purchases of domestic factor services as exports and domestic purchases of rest-of-world factor services as imports—the balance on current account equals net exports. When the balance on current account is positive, spending flowing in for the purchase of goods and services exceeds spending that flows out, and the economy has a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">current account surplus</a><span class="glossdef">Situation that occurs when spending flowing in for the purchase of goods and services exceeds spending that flows out.</span></span> (i.e., net exports are positive in our simplified analysis). When the balance on current account is negative, spending for goods and services that flows out of the country exceeds spending that flows in, and the economy has a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">current account deficit</a><span class="glossdef">Situation that occurs when spending for goods and services that flows out of the country exceeds spending that flows in.</span></span> (i.e., net exports are negative in our simplified analysis).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch15_s02_s01_p05">A country’s <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">capital account</a><span class="glossdef">An accounting statement of spending flows into and out of the country during a particular period for purchases of assets.</span></span> is an accounting statement of spending flows into and out of the country during a particular period for purchases of assets. The term within the parentheses on the right side of the equation gives the balance between rest-of-world purchases of domestic assets and domestic purchases of rest-of-world assets; this balance is a country’s <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">balance on capital account</a><span class="glossdef">The balance between rest-of-world purchases of domestic assets and domestic purchases of rest-of-world assets.</span></span>. A positive balance on capital account is a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">capital account surplus</a><span class="glossdef">A positive balance on capital account.</span></span>. A capital account surplus means that buyers in the rest of the world are purchasing more of a country’s assets than buyers in the domestic economy are spending on rest-of-world assets. A negative balance on capital account is a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">capital account deficit</a><span class="glossdef">A negative balance on capital account.</span></span>. It implies that buyers in the domestic economy are purchasing a greater volume of assets in other countries than buyers in other countries are spending on the domestic economy’s assets. Remember that the balance on capital account is the term <em class="emphasis">inside</em> the parentheses on the right-hand side of <a class="xref" href="#rittenmacro-ch15_s02_s01_eq01" xrefstyle="select: label">Equation 15.3</a> and that there is a minus sign <em class="emphasis">outside</em> the parentheses.</p>

Suppose, for example, that buyers in the rest of the world are spending $100 billion per year acquiring assets in a country, while that country’s buyers are spending $70 billion per year to acquire assets in the rest of the world. The country thus has a capital account surplus of $30 billion per year. <a class="xref" href="#rittenmacro-ch15_s02_s01_eq01" xrefstyle="select: label">Equation 15.3</a> tells us the country must have a current account deficit of $30 billion per year.</p>

A capital account deficit <em class="emphasis">necessarily</em> means a current account surplus. Similarly, a current account surplus implies a capital account deficit; a current account deficit implies a capital account surplus. Whenever the market for a country’s currency is in equilibrium, and it virtually always is in the absence of exchange rate controls, <a class="xref" href="#rittenmacro-ch15_s02_s01_eq01" xrefstyle="select: label">Equation 15.3</a> is an identity—it must be true. Thus, any surplus or deficit in the current account means the capital account has an offsetting deficit or surplus.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch15_s02_s01_p09">The accounting relationships underlying international finance hold as long as a country’s currency market is in equilibrium. But what are the economic forces at work that cause these equalities to hold? Consider how global turmoil in 1997 and 1998, discussed in the chapter opening, affected the United States. Holders of assets, including foreign currencies, in the rest of the world were understandably concerned that the values of those assets might fall. To avoid a plunge in the values of their own holdings, many of them purchased U.S. assets, including U.S. dollars. Those purchases of U.S. assets increased the U.S. surplus on capital account. To buy those assets, foreign purchasers had to purchase dollars. Also, U.S. citizens became less willing to hold foreign assets, and their preference for holding U.S. assets increased. United States citizens were thus less willing to supply dollars to the foreign exchange market. The increased demand for dollars and the decreased supply of dollars sent the U.S. exchange rate higher, as shown in Panel (a) of <a class="xref" href="#rittenmacro-ch15_s02_s01_f01">Figure 15.4 "A Change in the Exchange Rate Affected the U.S. Current and Capital Accounts in 1997 and 1998"</a>. Panel (b) shows the actual movement of the U.S. exchange rate in 1997 and 1998. Notice the sharp increases in the exchange rate throughout most of the period. A higher exchange rate in the United States reduces U.S. exports and increases U.S. imports, increasing the current account deficit. Panel (c) shows the movement of the current and capital accounts in the United States in 1997 and 1998. Notice that as the capital account surplus increased, the current account deficit rose. A reduction in the U.S. exchange rate at the end of 1998 coincided with a movement of these balances in the opposite direction.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Deficits and Surpluses: Good or Bad?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch15_s02_s02_p01">For the past quarter century, the United States has had a current account deficit and a capital account surplus. Is this good or bad?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch15_s02_s02_p02">Viewed from the perspective of consumers, neither phenomenon seems to pose a problem. A current account deficit is likely to imply a trade deficit. That means more goods and services are flowing into the country than are flowing out. A capital account surplus means more spending is flowing into the country for the purchase of assets than is flowing out. It is hard to see the harm in any of that.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch15_s02_s02_p03">Public opinion, however, appears to regard a current account deficit and capital account surplus as highly undesirable, perhaps because people associate a trade deficit with a loss of jobs. But that is erroneous; employment in the long run is determined by forces that have nothing to do with a trade deficit. An increase in the trade deficit (that is, a reduction in net exports) reduces aggregate demand in the short run, but net exports are only one component of aggregate demand. Other factors—consumption, investment, and government purchases—affect aggregate demand as well. There is no reason a trade deficit should imply a loss of jobs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch15_s02_s02_p04">What about foreign purchases of U.S. assets? One objection to such purchases is that if foreigners own U.S. assets, they will receive the income from those assets—spending will flow out of the country. But it is hard to see the harm in paying income to financial investors. When someone buys a bond issued by Microsoft, interest payments will flow from Microsoft to the bond holder. Does Microsoft view the purchase of its bond as a bad thing? Of course not. Despite the fact that Microsoft’s payment of interest on the bond and the ultimate repayment of the face value of the bond will exceed what the company originally received from the bond purchaser, Microsoft is surely not unhappy with the arrangement. It expects to put that money to more productive use; that is the reason it issued the bond in the first place.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch15_s02_s02_p05">A second concern about foreign asset purchases is that the United States in some sense loses sovereignty when foreigners buy its assets. But why should this be a problem? Foreign-owned firms competing in U.S. markets are at the mercy of those markets, as are firms owned by U.S. nationals. Foreign owners of U.S. real estate have no special power. What about foreign buyers of bonds issued by the U.S. government? Foreigners owned about 52% of these bonds at the end of December 2010; they are thus the creditors for about half the national debt. But this position hardly puts them in control of the government of the United States. They hold an obligation of the U.S. government to pay them a certain amount of U.S. dollars on a certain date, nothing more. A foreign owner could sell his or her bonds, but more than $100 billion worth of these bonds are sold every day. The resale of U.S. bonds by a foreign owner will not affect the U.S. government.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch15_s02_s02_p06">In short, there is no economic justification for concern about having a current account deficit and a capital account surplus—nor would there be an economic reason to be concerned about the opposite state of affairs. The important feature of international trade is its potential to improve living standards for people. It is not a game in which current account balances are the scorecard.</p>

            <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch15_s02_s02_p08">The growing U.S. current account deficit has generated considerable alarm. But, is there cause for alarm? In a speech in December 2005, former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan analyzed what he feels are the causes of the growing deficit and explains how the U.S. current account deficit may, under certain circumstances, decrease over time without a crisis.</p>
            <span class="blockquote" id="rittenmacro-ch15_s02_s02_bl01">
                <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch15_s02_s02_p09">“In November 2003, I noted that we saw little evidence of stress in funding the U.S. current account deficit even though the real exchange rate for the dollar, on net, had declined more than 10% since early 2002. … Two years later, little has changed except that our current account deficit has grown still larger. Most policy makers marvel at the seeming ease with which the United States continues to finance its current account deficit.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch15_s02_s02_p10">“Of course, deficits that cumulate to ever-increasing net external debt, with its attendant rise in servicing costs, cannot persist indefinitely. At some point, foreign investors will balk at a growing concentration of claims against U.S. residents … and will begin to alter their portfolios. … The rise of the U.S. current account deficit over the past decade appears to have coincided with a pronounced new phase of globalization that is characterized by a major acceleration in U.S. productivity growth and the decline in what economists call home bias. In brief, home bias is the parochial tendency of persons, though faced with comparable or superior foreign opportunities, to invest domestic savings in the home country. The decline in home bias is reflected in savers increasingly reaching across national borders to invest in foreign assets. The rise in U.S. productivity attracted much of those savings toward investments in the United States. …</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch15_s02_s02_p11">“Accordingly, it is tempting to conclude that the U.S. current account deficit is essentially a byproduct of long-term secular forces, and thus is largely benign. After all, we do seem to have been able to finance our international current account deficit with relative ease in recent years.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch15_s02_s02_p12">“But does the apparent continued rise in the deficits of U.S. individual households and nonfinancial businesses themselves reflect growing economic strain? (We do not think so.) And does it matter how those deficits of individual economic entities are being financed? Specifically, does the recent growing proportion of these deficits being financed, net, by foreigners matter? …</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch15_s02_s02_p13">“If the currently disturbing drift toward protectionism is contained and markets remain sufficiently flexible, changing terms of trade, interest rates, asset prices, and exchange rates will cause U.S. saving to rise, reducing the need for foreign finance, and reversing the trend of the past decade toward increasing reliance on it. If, however, the pernicious drift toward fiscal instability in the United States and elsewhere is not arrested and is compounded by a protectionist reversal of globalization, the adjustment process could be quite painful for the world economy.”</p>
