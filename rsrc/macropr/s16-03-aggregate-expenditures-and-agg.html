        <h2 class="title editable block">Aggregate Expenditures Curves and Price Levels</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s03_s01_p01">An aggregate expenditures curve assumes a fixed price level. If the price level were to change, the levels of consumption, investment, and net exports would all change, producing a new aggregate expenditures curve and a new equilibrium solution in the aggregate expenditures model.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s03_s01_p02">A change in the price level changes people’s real wealth. Suppose, for example, that your wealth includes $10,000 in a bond account. An increase in the price level would reduce the real value of this money, reduce your real wealth, and thus reduce your consumption. Similarly, a reduction in the price level would increase the real value of money holdings and thus increase real wealth and consumption. The tendency for price level changes to change real wealth and consumption is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">wealth effect</a><span class="glossdef">The tendency for price level changes to change real wealth and consumption.</span></span>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s03_s01_p03">Because changes in the price level also affect the real quantity of money, we can expect a change in the price level to change the interest rate. A reduction in the price level will increase the real quantity of money and thus lower the interest rate. A lower interest rate, all other things unchanged, will increase the level of investment. Similarly, a higher price level reduces the real quantity of money, raises interest rates, and reduces investment. This is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">interest rate effect</a><span class="glossdef">The tendency for a higher price level to reduce the real quantity of money, raise interest rates, and reduce investment.</span></span>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s03_s01_p04">Finally, a change in the domestic price level will affect exports and imports. A higher price level makes a country’s exports fall and imports rise, reducing net exports. A lower price level will increase exports and reduce imports, increasing net exports. This impact of different price levels on the level of net exports is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">international trade effect</a><span class="glossdef">The impact of different price levels on the level of net exports.</span></span>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s03_s01_p05">Panel (a) of <a class="xref" href="#rittenmacro-ch13_s03_s01_f01">Figure 13.13 "From Aggregate Expenditures to Aggregate Demand"</a> shows three possible aggregate expenditures curves for three different price levels. For example, the aggregate expenditures curve labeled <em class="emphasis">AE</em><sub class="subscript">P=1.0</sub> is the aggregate expenditures curve for an economy with a price level of 1.0. Since that aggregate expenditures curve crosses the 45-degree line at $6,000 billion, equilibrium real GDP is $6,000 billion at that price level. At a lower price level, aggregate expenditures would rise because of the wealth effect, the interest rate effect, and the international trade effect. Assume that at every level of real GDP, a reduction in the price level to 0.5 would boost aggregate expenditures by $2,000 billion to <em class="emphasis">AE</em><sub class="subscript">P = 0.5</sub>, and an increase in the price level from 1.0 to 1.5 would reduce aggregate expenditures by $2,000 billion. The aggregate expenditures curve for a price level of 1.5 is shown as <em class="emphasis">AE</em><sub class="subscript">P=1.5</sub>. There is a different aggregate expenditures curve, and a different level of equilibrium real GDP, for each of these three price levels. A price level of 1.5 produces equilibrium at point A, a price level of 1.0 does so at point B, and a price level of 0.5 does so at point C. More generally, there will be a different level of equilibrium real GDP for every price level; the higher the price level, the lower the equilibrium value of real GDP.</p>

            <p class="para">Because there is a different aggregate expenditures curve for each price level, there is a different equilibrium real GDP for each price level. Panel (a) shows aggregate expenditures curves for three different price levels. Panel (b) shows that the aggregate demand curve, which shows the quantity of goods and services demanded at each price level, can thus be derived from the aggregate expenditures model. The aggregate expenditures curve for a price level of 1.0, for example, intersects the 45-degree line in Panel (a) at point B, producing an equilibrium real GDP of $6,000 billion. We can thus plot point B′ on the aggregate demand curve in Panel (b), which shows that at a price level of 1.0, a real GDP of $6,000 billion is demanded.</p>

The equilibrium real GDP associated with each price level in the aggregate expenditures model is plotted as a point showing the price level and the quantity of goods and services demanded (measured as real GDP). At a price level of 1.0, for example, the equilibrium level of real GDP in the aggregate expenditures model in Panel (a) is $6,000 billion at point B. That means $6,000 billion worth of goods and services is demanded; point B' on the aggregate demand curve in Panel (b) corresponds to a real GDP demanded of $6,000 billion and a price level of 1.0. At a price level of 0.5 the equilibrium GDP demanded is $10,000 billion at point C', and at a price level of 1.5 the equilibrium real GDP demanded is $2,000 billion at point A'. The aggregate demand curve thus shows the equilibrium real GDP from the aggregate expenditures model at each price level.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Multiplier and Changes in Aggregate Demand</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s03_s02_p01">In the aggregate expenditures model, a change in autonomous aggregate expenditures changes equilibrium real GDP by the multiplier times the change in autonomous aggregate expenditures. That model, however, assumes a constant price level. How can we incorporate the concept of the multiplier into the model of aggregate demand and aggregate supply?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s03_s02_p02">Consider the aggregate expenditures curves given in Panel (a) of <a class="xref" href="#rittenmacro-ch13_s03_s02_f01">Figure 13.14 "Changes in Aggregate Demand"</a>, each of which corresponds to a particular price level. Suppose net exports rise by $1,000 billion. Such a change increases aggregate expenditures at each price level by $1,000 billion.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s03_s02_p03">A $1,000-billion increase in net exports shifts each of the aggregate expenditures curves up by $1,000 billion, to <em class="emphasis">AE</em>′<sub class="subscript">P=1.0</sub> and <em class="emphasis">AE</em>′<sub class="subscript">P=1.5</sub>. That changes the equilibrium real GDP associated with each price level; it thus shifts the aggregate demand curve to <em class="emphasis">AD</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub> in Panel (b). In the aggregate expenditures model, equilibrium real GDP changes by an amount equal to the initial change in autonomous aggregate expenditures times the multiplier, so the aggregate demand curve shifts by the same amount. In this example, we assume the multiplier is 2. The aggregate demand curve thus shifts to the right by $2,000 billion, two times the $1,000-billion change in autonomous aggregate expenditures.</p>

            <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s03_s02_p06">Using a large-scale model of the U.S. economy to simulate the effects of government policies, Princeton University professor Alan Blinder and Moody Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi concluded that the expansionary fiscal, monetary, and other policies aimed at relieving the financial crisis (such as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP) worked together from 2008 onward to effectively combat the Great Recession and probably kept it from turning into the Great Depression 2.0. Specifically, they estimated that U.S. GDP would have fallen about 12% peak-to-trough and that the unemployment rate would have hit 16.5% without these policies, instead of GDP declining about 4% and the unemployment rate reaching about 10%. While they attribute the bulk of the improvement to monetary and other financial policies, they found that fiscal policies also played a substantial role. For example, they concluded that fiscal stimulus added more than 3% to real GDP in 2010.</p>

The following table provides estimates for the multiplied effects of various stimulus measures that were considered. In general, they estimate a stronger “bang for the buck,” or multiplier, from spending increases than from tax cuts.</p>
