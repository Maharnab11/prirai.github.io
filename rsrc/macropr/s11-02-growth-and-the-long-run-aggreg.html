It shows output levels for a range of employment between 120 million and 140 million workers. When the level of employment is 120 million, the economy produces a real GDP of $11,500 billion (point A). A level of employment of 130 million produces a real GDP of $12,000 billion (point B), and when 140 million workers are employed, a real GDP of $12,300 billion is produced (point C). In drawing the aggregate production function, the amount of labor varies, but everything else that could affect output, specifically the quantities of other factors of production and technology, is fixed.</p>

The firm is able to increase output by adding workers. But because the firm’s plant size and stock of equipment are fixed, the firm’s capital per worker falls as it takes on more workers. Each additional worker adds less to output than the worker before. The firm, like the economy, experiences diminishing marginal returns.</p>

                <p class="para">An improvement in technology shifts the aggregate production function upward in Panel (b).

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch08_s02_s02_s01_p03">The shift in the production function to <em class="emphasis">PF</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub> means that labor is now more productive than before. This will affect the demand for labor in Panel (a). Before the technological change, firms employed <em class="emphasis">L</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub> workers at a real wage ω<sub class="subscript">1</sub>. If workers are more productive, firms will find it profitable to hire more of them at ω<sub class="subscript">1</sub>. The demand curve for labor thus shifts to <em class="emphasis">D</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub> in Panel (a). The real wage rises to ω<sub class="subscript">2</sub>, and the natural level of employment rises to <em class="emphasis">L</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub>. The increase in the real wage reflects labor’s enhanced <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">productivity</a><span class="glossdef">The amount of output per worker.</span></span>, the amount of output per worker. To see how potential output changes, we see in Panel (b) how much output can be produced given the new natural level of employment and the new aggregate production function. The real GDP that the economy is capable of producing rises from <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub> to <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub>. The higher output is a reflection of a higher natural level of employment, along with the fact that labor has become more productive as a result of the technological advance. In Panel (c) the long-run aggregate supply curve shifts to the right to the vertical line at <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub>.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch08_s02_s02_s01_p04">This analysis dispels a common misconception about the impact of improvements in technology or increases in the capital stock on employment. Some people believe that technological gains or increases in the stock of capital reduce the demand for labor, reduce employment, and reduce real wages. Certainly the experience of the United States and most other countries belies that notion. Between 1990 and 2007, for example, the U.S. capital stock and the level of technology increased dramatically. During the same period, employment and real wages rose, suggesting that the demand for labor increased by more than the supply of labor. As some firms add capital or incorporate new technologies, some workers at those firms may lose their jobs. But for the economy as a whole, new jobs become available <em class="emphasis">and</em> they generally offer higher wages. The demand for labor rises.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch08_s02_s02_s01_p05">Another event that can shift the long-run aggregate supply curve is an increase in the supply of labor, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#rittenmacro-ch08_s02_s02_s01_f02">Figure 8.8 "Increase in the Supply of Labor and the Long-Run Aggregate Supply Curve"</a>. An increased supply of labor could result from immigration, an increase in the population, or increased participation in the labor force by the adult population. Increased participation by women in the labor force, for example, has tended to increase the supply curve for labor during the past several decades.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch08_s02_s02_s01_p06">In Panel (a), an increase in the labor supply shifts the supply curve to <em class="emphasis">S</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub>. The increase in the supply of labor does not change the stock of capital or natural resources, nor does it change technology—it therefore does not shift the aggregate production function. Because there is no change in the production function, there is no shift in the demand for labor. The real wage falls from ω<sub class="subscript">1</sub> to ω<sub class="subscript">2</sub> in Panel (a), and the natural level of employment rises from <em class="emphasis">L</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub> to <em class="emphasis">L</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub>. To see the impact on potential output, Panel (b) shows that employment of <em class="emphasis">L</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub> can produce real GDP of <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub>. The long-run aggregate supply curve in Panel (c) thus shifts to <em class="emphasis">LRAS</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub>. Notice, however, that this shift in the long-run aggregate supply curve to the right is associated with a reduction in the real wage to ω<sub class="subscript">2</sub>.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch08_s02_s02_s01_p07">Of course, the aggregate production function and the supply curve of labor can shift together, producing higher real wages at the same time population rises. That has been the experience of most industrialized nations. The increase in real wages in the United States between 1990 and 2007, for example, came during a period in which an increasing population increased the supply of labor. The demand for labor increased by more than the supply, pushing the real wage up. The accompanying Case in Point looks at gains in real wages in the face of technological change, an increase in the stock of capital, and rapid population growth in the United States during the 19th century.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch08_s02_s02_s01_p08">Our model of long-run aggregate supply tells us that in the long run, real GDP, the natural level of employment, and the real wage are determined by the economy’s production function and by the demand and supply curves for labor. Unless an event shifts the aggregate production function, the demand curve for labor, or the supply curve for labor, it affects neither the natural level of employment nor potential output. Economic growth occurs only if an event shifts the economy’s production function or if there is an increase in the demand for or the supply of labor.</p>

Such changes, critics argue, hurt workers. Using the model of aggregate demand and aggregate supply, however, we arrive at a quite different conclusion. The model predicts that improved technology will increase the demand for labor and boost real wages.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch08_s02_s02_s01_p11">The period of industrialization, generally taken to be the time between the Civil War and World War I, was a good test of these competing ideas. Technological changes were dramatic as firms shifted toward mass production and automation. Capital investment soared. Immigration increased the supply of labor. What happened to workers?</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch08_s02_s02_s01_p12">Employment more than doubled during this period, consistent with the prediction of our model. It is harder to predict, from a theoretical point of view, the consequences for real wages. The latter third of the 19th century was a period of massive immigration to the United States. Between 1865 and 1880, more than 5 million people came to the United States from abroad; most were of working age. The pace accelerated between 1880 and 1923, when more than 23 million people moved to the United States from other countries. Immigration increased the supply of labor, which should reduce the real wage. There were thus two competing forces at work: Technological change and capital investment tended to increase real wages, while immigration tended to reduce them by increasing the supply of labor.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch08_s02_s02_s01_p13">The evidence suggests that the forces of technological change and capital investment proved far more powerful than increases in labor supply. Real wages soared 60% between 1860 and 1890. They continued to increase after that. Real wages in manufacturing, for example, rose 37% from 1890 to 1914.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch08_s02_s02_s01_p14">Technological change and capital investment displace workers in some industries. But for the economy as a whole, they increase worker productivity, increase the demand for labor, and increase real wages.</p>
