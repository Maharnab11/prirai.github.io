        <h2 class="title editable block">Start Up: The Great Warning</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s00_p01">The first warning came from the Harvard Economic Society, an association of Harvard economics professors, early in 1929. The society predicted in its weekly newsletter that the seven-year-old expansion was coming to an end. Recession was ahead. Almost no one took the warning seriously. The economy, fueled by soaring investment, had experienced stunning growth. The 1920s had seen the emergence of many entirely new industries—automobiles, public power, home appliances, synthetic fabrics, radio, and motion pictures. The decade seemed to have acquired a momentum all its own. Prosperity was not about to end, no matter what a few economists might say.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s00_p02">Summer came, and no recession was apparent. The Harvard economists withdrew their forecast. As it turned out, they lost their nerve too soon. Indeed, industrial production had already begun to fall. The worst downturn in our history, the Great Depression, had begun.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s00_p03">The collapse was swift. The stock market crashed in October 1929. Real GDP plunged nearly 10% by 1930. By the time the economy hit bottom in 1933, real GDP had fallen 30%, unemployment had increased from 3.2% in 1929 to 25% in 1933, and prices, measured by the implicit price deflator, had plunged 23% from their 1929 level. The depression held the economy in its cruel grip for more than a decade; it was not until World War II that full employment was restored.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s00_p04">In this chapter we go beyond explanations of the main macroeconomic variables to introduce a model of macroeconomic activity that we can use to analyze problems such as fluctuations in gross domestic product (real GDP), the price level, and employment: the model of aggregate demand and aggregate supply. We will use this model throughout our exploration of macroeconomics. In this chapter we will present the broad outlines of the model; greater detail, more examples, and more thorough explanations will follow in subsequent chapters.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s00_p05">We will examine the concepts of the aggregate demand curve and the short- and long-run aggregate supply curves. We will identify conditions under which an economy achieves an equilibrium level of real GDP that is consistent with full employment of labor. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Potential output</a><span class="glossdef">The level of output an economy can achieve when labor is employed at its natural level.</span></span> is the level of output an economy can achieve when labor is employed at its natural level. Potential output is also called the natural level of real GDP. When an economy fails to produce at its potential, there may be actions that the government or the central bank can take to push the economy toward it, and in this chapter we will begin to consider the pros and cons of doing so.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Slope of the Aggregate Demand Curve</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s01_s01_p01">We will use the implicit price deflator as our measure of the price level; the aggregate quantity of goods and services demanded is measured as real GDP. The table in <a class="xref" href="#rittenmacro-ch07_s01_s01_f01">Figure 7.1 "Aggregate Demand"</a> gives values for each component of aggregate demand at each price level for a hypothetical economy. Various points on the aggregate demand curve are found by adding the values of these components at different price levels. The aggregate demand curve for the data given in the table is plotted on the graph in <a class="xref" href="#rittenmacro-ch07_s01_s01_f01">Figure 7.1 "Aggregate Demand"</a>. At point A, at a price level of 1.18, $11,800 billion worth of goods and services will be demanded; at point C, a reduction in the price level to 1.14 increases the quantity of goods and services demanded to $12,000 billion; and at point E, at a price level of 1.10, $12,200 billion will be demanded.</p>
        <div class="figure large medium-height editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s01_s01_f01">
            <p class="title"><span class="title-prefix">Figure 7.1</span> Aggregate Demand</p>
            <img src="section_10/4711d4d08f9941546160dcb5b5ad6cb8.jpg">
            <p class="para">An aggregate demand curve (<em class="emphasis">AD</em>) shows the relationship between the total quantity of output demanded (measured as real GDP) and the price level (measured as the implicit price deflator). At each price level, the total quantity of goods and services demanded is the sum of the components of real GDP, as shown in the table. There is a negative relationship between the price level and the total quantity of goods and services demanded, all other things unchanged.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s01_s01_p02">The negative slope of the aggregate demand curve suggests that it behaves in the same manner as an ordinary demand curve. But we <em class="emphasis">cannot</em> apply the reasoning we use to explain downward-sloping demand curves in individual markets to explain the downward-sloping aggregate demand curve. There are two reasons for a negative relationship between price and quantity demanded in individual markets. First, a lower price induces people to substitute more of the good whose price has fallen for other goods, increasing the quantity demanded. Second, the lower price creates a higher real income. This normally increases quantity demanded further.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s01_s01_p03">Neither of these effects is relevant to a change in prices in the aggregate. When we are dealing with the average of all prices—the price level—we can no longer say that a fall in prices will induce a change in relative prices that will lead consumers to buy more of the goods and services whose prices have fallen and less of the goods and services whose prices have not fallen. The price of corn may have fallen, but the prices of wheat, sugar, tractors, steel, and most other goods or services produced in the economy are likely to have fallen as well.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s01_s01_p04">Furthermore, a reduction in the price level means that it is not just the prices consumers pay that are falling. It means the prices people receive—their wages, the rents they may charge as landlords, the interest rates they earn—are likely to be falling as well. A falling price level means that goods and services are cheaper, but incomes are lower, too. There is no reason to expect that a change in real income will boost the quantity of goods and services demanded—indeed, no change in real income would occur. If nominal incomes and prices all fall by 10%, for example, real incomes do not change.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s01_s01_p05">Why, then, does the aggregate demand curve slope downward? One reason for the downward slope of the aggregate demand curve lies in the relationship between real wealth (the stocks, bonds, and other assets that people have accumulated) and consumption (one of the four components of aggregate demand). When the price level falls, the real value of wealth increases—it packs more purchasing power. For example, if the price level falls by 25%, then $10,000 of wealth could purchase more goods and services than it would have if the price level had not fallen. An increase in wealth will induce people to increase their consumption. The consumption component of aggregate demand will thus be greater at lower price levels than at higher price levels. The tendency for a change in the price level to affect real wealth and thus alter consumption is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">wealth effect</a><span class="glossdef">The tendency for a change in the price level to affect real wealth and thus alter consumption.</span></span>; it suggests a negative relationship between the price level and the real value of consumption spending.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s01_s01_p06">A second reason the aggregate demand curve slopes downward lies in the relationship between interest rates and investment. A lower price level lowers the demand for money, because less money is required to buy a given quantity of goods. What economists mean by money demand will be explained in more detail in a later chapter. But, as we learned in studying demand and supply, a reduction in the demand for something, all other things unchanged, lowers its price. In this case, the “something” is money and its price is the interest rate. A lower price level thus reduces interest rates. Lower interest rates make borrowing by firms to build factories or buy equipment and other capital more attractive. A lower interest rate means lower mortgage payments, which tends to increase investment in residential houses. Investment thus rises when the price level falls. The tendency for a change in the price level to affect the interest rate and thus to affect the quantity of investment demanded is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">interest rate effect</a><span class="glossdef">The tendency for a change in the price level to affect the interest rate and thus to affect the quantity of investment demanded.</span></span>. John Maynard Keynes, a British economist whose analysis of the Great Depression and what to do about it led to the birth of modern macroeconomics, emphasized this effect. For this reason, the interest rate effect is sometimes called the Keynes effect.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s01_s01_p07">A third reason for the rise in the total quantity of goods and services demanded as the price level falls can be found in changes in the net export component of aggregate demand. All other things unchanged, a lower price level in an economy reduces the prices of its goods and services relative to foreign-produced goods and services. A lower price level makes that economy’s goods more attractive to foreign buyers, increasing exports. It will also make foreign-produced goods and services less attractive to the economy’s buyers, reducing imports. The result is an increase in net exports. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">international trade effect</a><span class="glossdef">The tendency for a change in the price level to affect net exports.</span></span> is the tendency for a change in the price level to affect net exports.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s01_s01_p08">Taken together, then, a fall in the price level means that the quantities of consumption, investment, and net export components of aggregate demand may all rise. Since government purchases are determined through a political process, we assume there is no causal link between the price level and the real volume of government purchases. Therefore, this component of GDP does not contribute to the downward slope of the curve.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s01_s01_p09">In general, a change in the price level, with all other determinants of aggregate demand unchanged, causes a movement along the aggregate demand curve. A movement along an aggregate demand curve is a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">change in the aggregate quantity of goods and services demanded</a><span class="glossdef">Movement along an aggregate demand curve.</span></span>. A movement from point A to point B on the aggregate demand curve in <a class="xref" href="#rittenmacro-ch07_s01_s01_f01">Figure 7.1 "Aggregate Demand"</a> is an example. Such a change is a response to a change in the price level.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s01_s01_p10">Notice that the axes of the aggregate demand curve graph are drawn with a break near the origin to remind us that the plotted values reflect a relatively narrow range of changes in real GDP and the price level. We do not know what might happen if the price level or output for an entire economy approached zero. Such a phenomenon has never been observed.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Changes in Aggregate Demand</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s01_s02_p01">Aggregate demand changes in response to a change in any of its components. An increase in the total quantity of consumer goods and services demanded at every price level, for example, would shift the aggregate demand curve to the right. A change in the aggregate quantity of goods and services demanded at every price level is a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">change in aggregate demand</a><span class="glossdef">Change in the aggregate quantity of goods and services demanded at every price level.</span></span>, which shifts the aggregate demand curve. Increases and decreases in aggregate demand are shown in <a class="xref" href="#rittenmacro-ch07_s01_s02_f01">Figure 7.2 "Changes in Aggregate Demand"</a>.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s01_s02_p02">What factors might cause the aggregate demand curve to shift? Each of the components of aggregate demand is a possible aggregate demand shifter. We shall look at some of the events that can trigger changes in the components of aggregate demand and thus shift the aggregate demand curve.</p>
        <div class="section" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s01_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Changes in Consumption</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s01_s02_s01_p01">Several events could change the quantity of consumption at each price level and thus shift aggregate demand. One determinant of consumption is consumer confidence. If consumers expect good economic conditions and are optimistic about their economic prospects, they are more likely to buy major items such as cars or furniture. The result would be an increase in the real value of consumption at each price level and an increase in aggregate demand. In the second half of the 1990s, sustained economic growth and low unemployment fueled high expectations and consumer optimism. Surveys revealed consumer confidence to be very high. That consumer confidence translated into increased consumption and increased aggregate demand. In contrast, a decrease in consumption would accompany diminished consumer expectations and a decrease in consumer confidence, as happened after the stock market crash of 1929. The same problem has plagued the economies of most Western nations in 2008 as declining consumer confidence has tended to reduce consumption. A survey by the Conference Board in September of 2008 showed that just 13.5% of consumers surveyed expected economic conditions in the United States to improve in the next six months. Similarly pessimistic views prevailed in the previous two months. That contributed to the decline in consumption that occurred in the third quarter of the year.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s01_s02_s01_p02">Another factor that can change consumption and shift aggregate demand is tax policy. A cut in personal income taxes leaves people with more after-tax income, which may induce them to increase their consumption. The federal government in the United States cut taxes in 1964, 1981, 1986, 1997, and 2003; each of those tax cuts tended to increase consumption and aggregate demand at each price level.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s01_s02_s01_p03">In the United States, another government policy aimed at increasing consumption and thus aggregate demand has been the use of rebates in which taxpayers are simply sent checks in hopes that those checks will be used for consumption. Rebates have been used in 1975, 2001, and 2008. In each case the rebate was a one-time payment. Careful studies by economists of the 1975 and 2001 rebates showed little impact on consumption. Final evidence on the impact of the 2008 rebates is not yet in, but early results suggest a similar outcome. In a subsequent chapter, we will investigate arguments about whether temporary increases in income produced by rebates are likely to have a significant impact on consumption.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s01_s02_s01_p04">Transfer payments such as welfare and Social Security also affect the income people have available to spend. At any given price level, an increase in transfer payments raises consumption and aggregate demand, and a reduction lowers consumption and aggregate demand.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s01_s02_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Changes in Investment</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s01_s02_s02_p01">Investment is the production of new capital that will be used for future production of goods and services. Firms make investment choices based on what they think they will be producing in the future. The expectations of firms thus play a critical role in determining investment. If firms expect their sales to go up, they are likely to increase their investment so that they can increase production and meet consumer demand. Such an increase in investment raises the aggregate quantity of goods and services demanded at each price level; it increases aggregate demand.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s01_s02_s02_p02">Changes in interest rates also affect investment and thus affect aggregate demand. We must be careful to distinguish such changes from the interest rate effect, which causes a movement along the aggregate demand curve. A change in interest rates that results from a change in the price level affects investment in a way that is already captured in the downward slope of the aggregate demand curve; it causes a movement along the curve. A change in interest rates for some other reason shifts the curve. We examine reasons interest rates might change in another chapter.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s01_s02_s02_p03">Investment can also be affected by tax policy. One provision of the Job and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 was a reduction in the tax rate on certain capital gains. Capital gains result when the owner of an asset, such as a house or a factory, sells the asset for more than its purchase price (less any depreciation claimed in earlier years). The lower capital gains tax could stimulate investment, because the owners of such assets know that they will lose less to taxes when they sell those assets, thus making assets subject to the tax more attractive.</p>

        <div class="section" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s01_s02_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Changes in Government Purchases</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s01_s02_s03_p01">Any change in government purchases, all other things unchanged, will affect aggregate demand. An increase in government purchases increases aggregate demand; a decrease in government purchases decreases aggregate demand.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s01_s02_s03_p02">Many economists argued that reductions in defense spending in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 tended to reduce aggregate demand. Similarly, increased defense spending for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq increased aggregate demand. Dramatic increases in defense spending to fight World War II accounted in large part for the rapid recovery from the Great Depression.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s01_s02_s04">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Changes in Net Exports</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s01_s02_s04_p01">A change in the value of net exports at each price level shifts the aggregate demand curve. A major determinant of net exports is foreign demand for a country’s goods and services; that demand will vary with foreign incomes. An increase in foreign incomes increases a country’s net exports and aggregate demand; a slump in foreign incomes reduces net exports and aggregate demand. For example, several major U.S. trading partners in Asia suffered recessions in 1997 and 1998. Lower real incomes in those countries reduced U.S. exports and tended to reduce aggregate demand.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s01_s02_s04_p02">Exchange rates also influence net exports, all other things unchanged. A country’s <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">exchange rate</a><span class="glossdef">The price of a currency in terms of another currency or currencies.</span></span> is the price of its currency in terms of another currency or currencies. A rise in the U.S. exchange rate means that it takes more Japanese yen, for example, to purchase one dollar. That also means that U.S. traders get more yen per dollar. Since prices of goods produced in Japan are given in yen and prices of goods produced in the United States are given in dollars, a rise in the U.S. exchange rate increases the price to foreigners for goods and services produced in the United States, thus reducing U.S. exports; it reduces the price of foreign-produced goods and services for U.S. consumers, thus increasing imports to the United States. A higher exchange rate tends to reduce net exports, reducing aggregate demand. A lower exchange rate tends to increase net exports, increasing aggregate demand.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s01_s02_s04_p03">Foreign price levels can affect aggregate demand in the same way as exchange rates. For example, when foreign price levels fall relative to the price level in the United States, U.S. goods and services become relatively more expensive, reducing exports and boosting imports in the United States. Such a reduction in net exports reduces aggregate demand. An increase in foreign prices relative to U.S. prices has the opposite effect.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s01_s02_s04_p04">The trade policies of various countries can also affect net exports. A policy by Japan to increase its imports of goods and services from India, for example, would increase net exports in India.</p>

In March 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued its first worldwide alert and a month later its first travel advisory, which recommended that travelers avoid Hong Kong and the southern province of China, Guangdong. Over the next few months, additional travel advisories were issued for other parts of China, Taiwan, and briefly for Toronto, Canada. By the end of June, all WHO travel advisories had been removed.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s01_s02_s05_p08">To estimate the overall impact of SARS on the Chinese economy in 2003, economists Wen Hai, Zhong Zhao, and Jian Want of Peking University’s China Center for Economic Research conducted a survey of Beijing’s tourism industry in April 2003. Based on findings from the Beijing area, they projected the tourism sector of China as a whole would lose $16.8 billion—of which $10.8 billion came from an approximate 50% reduction in foreign tourist revenue and $6 billion from curtailed domestic tourism, as holiday celebrations were cancelled and domestic travel restrictions imposed.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s01_s02_s05_p09">To figure out the total impact of SARS on China’s economy, they argued that the multiplier for tourism revenue in China is between 2 and 3. Since the SARS outbreak only began to have a major economic impact after March, they assumed a smaller multiplier of 1.5 for all of 2003. They thus predicted that the Chinese economy would be $25.3 billion smaller in 2003 as a result of SARS.</p>

If all prices in the economy adjusted quickly, the economy would quickly settle at potential output of $12,000 billion, but at a higher price level (1.18 in this case).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s02_s02_s01_p03">Is it possible to expand output above potential? Yes. It may be the case, for example, that some people who were in the labor force but were frictionally or structurally unemployed find work because of the ease of getting jobs at the going nominal wage in such an environment. The result is an economy operating at point A in <a class="xref" href="#rittenmacro-ch07_s02_s02_s01_f01">Figure 7.6 "Deriving the Short-Run Aggregate Supply Curve"</a> at a higher price level and with output temporarily above potential.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s02_s02_s01_p04">Consider next the effect of a reduction in aggregate demand (to <em class="emphasis">AD</em><sub class="subscript">3</sub>), possibly due to a reduction in investment. As the price level starts to fall, output also falls. The economy finds itself at a price level–output combination at which real GDP is below potential, at point C. Again, price stickiness is to blame. The prices firms receive are falling with the reduction in demand. Without corresponding reductions in nominal wages, there will be an increase in the real wage. Firms will employ less labor and produce less output.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s02_s02_s01_p05">By examining what happens as aggregate demand shifts over a period when price adjustment is incomplete, we can trace out the short-run aggregate supply curve by drawing a line through points A, B, and C. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve</a><span class="glossdef">A graphical representation of the relationship between production and the price level in the short run.</span></span> is a graphical representation of the relationship between production and the price level in the short run.

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s02_s02_s01_p06">A change in the price level produces a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">change in the aggregate quantity of goods and services supplied</a><span class="glossdef">Movement along the short-run aggregate supply curve.</span></span> and is illustrated by the movement along the short-run aggregate supply curve.

Changes in the factors held constant in drawing the short-run aggregate supply curve shift the curve.

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s02_s02_s01_p08">One type of event that would shift the short-run aggregate supply curve is an increase in the price of a natural resource such as oil. An increase in the price of natural resources or any other factor of production, all other things unchanged, raises the cost of production and leads to a reduction in short-run aggregate supply.

            <h2 class="title editable block">Reasons for Wage and Price Stickiness</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s02_s02_s02_p01">Wage or price stickiness means that the economy may not always be operating at potential. Rather, the economy may operate either above or below potential output in the short run. Correspondingly, the overall unemployment rate will be below or above the natural level.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s02_s02_s02_p02">Many prices observed throughout the economy do adjust quickly to changes in market conditions so that equilibrium, once lost, is quickly regained. Prices for fresh food and shares of common stock are two such examples.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s02_s02_s02_p03">Other prices, though, adjust more slowly. Nominal wages, the price of labor, adjust very slowly. We will first look at why nominal wages are sticky, due to their association with the unemployment rate, a variable of great interest in macroeconomics, and then at other prices that may be sticky.</p>
            <div class="section" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s02_s02_s03_s01">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Wage Stickiness</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s02_s02_s03_s01_p01">Wage contracts fix nominal wages for the life of the contract. The length of wage contracts varies from one week or one month for temporary employees, to one year (teachers and professors often have such contracts), to three years (for most union workers employed under major collective bargaining agreements). The existence of such explicit contracts means that both workers and firms accept some wage at the time of negotiating, even though economic conditions could change while the agreement is still in force.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s02_s02_s03_s01_p02">Think about your own job or a job you once had. Chances are you go to work each day knowing what your wage will be. Your wage does not fluctuate from one day to the next with changes in demand or supply. You may have a formal contract with your employer that specifies what your wage will be over some period. Or you may have an informal understanding that sets your wage. Whatever the nature of your agreement, your wage is “stuck” over the period of the agreement. Your wage is an example of a sticky price.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s02_s02_s03_s01_p03">One reason workers and firms may be willing to accept long-term nominal wage contracts is that negotiating a contract is a costly process. Both parties must keep themselves adequately informed about market conditions. Where unions are involved, wage negotiations raise the possibility of a labor strike, an eventuality that firms may prepare for by accumulating additional inventories, also a costly process. Even when unions are not involved, time and energy spent discussing wages takes away from time and energy spent producing goods and services. In addition, workers may simply prefer knowing that their nominal wage will be fixed for some period of time.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s02_s02_s03_s01_p04">Some contracts do attempt to take into account changing economic conditions, such as inflation, through cost-of-living adjustments, but even these relatively simple contingencies are not as widespread as one might think. One reason might be that a firm is concerned that while the aggregate price level is rising, the prices for the goods and services it sells might not be moving at the same rate. Also, cost-of-living or other contingencies add complexity to contracts that both sides may want to avoid.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s02_s02_s03_s01_p05">Even markets where workers are not employed under explicit contracts seem to behave as if such contracts existed. In these cases, wage stickiness may stem from a desire to avoid the same uncertainty and adjustment costs that explicit contracts avert.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s02_s02_s03_s01_p06">Finally, minimum wage laws prevent wages from falling below a legal minimum, even if unemployment is rising. Unskilled workers are particularly vulnerable to shifts in aggregate demand.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Price Stickiness</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s02_s02_s03_s02_p01">Rigidity of other prices becomes easier to explain in light of the arguments about nominal wage stickiness. Since wages are a major component of the overall cost of doing business, wage stickiness may lead to output price stickiness. With nominal wages stable, at least some firms can adopt a “wait and see” attitude before adjusting their prices. During this time, they can evaluate information about why sales are rising or falling (Is the change in demand temporary or permanent?) and try to assess likely reactions by consumers or competing firms in the industry to any price changes they might make (Will consumers be angered by a price increase, for example? Will competing firms match price changes?).</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s02_s02_s03_s02_p02">In the meantime, firms may prefer to adjust output and employment in response to changing market conditions, leaving product price alone. Quantity adjustments have costs, but firms may assume that the associated risks are smaller than those associated with price adjustments.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s02_s02_s03_s02_p03">Another possible explanation for price stickiness is the notion that there are adjustment costs associated with changing prices. In some cases, firms must print new price lists and catalogs, and notify customers of price changes. Doing this too often could jeopardize customer relations.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s02_s02_s03_s02_p04">Yet another explanation of price stickiness is that firms may have explicit long-term contracts to sell their products to other firms at specified prices. For example, electric utilities often buy their inputs of coal or oil under long-term contracts.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s02_s02_s03_s02_p05">Taken together, these reasons for wage and price stickiness explain why aggregate price adjustment may be incomplete in the sense that the change in the price level is insufficient to maintain real GDP at its potential level. These reasons do not lead to the conclusion that no price adjustments occur. But the adjustments require some time. During this time, the economy may remain above or below its potential level of output.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s02_s02_s04_p01">To illustrate how we will use the model of aggregate demand and aggregate supply, let us examine the impact of two events: an increase in the cost of health care and an increase in government purchases. The first reduces short-run aggregate supply; the second increases aggregate demand. Both events change equilibrium real GDP and the price level in the short run.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s02_s02_s04_s01_p01">In the United States, most people receive health insurance for themselves and their families through their employers. In fact, it is quite common for employers to pay a large percentage of employees’ health insurance premiums, and this benefit is often written into labor contracts. As the cost of health care has gone up over time, firms have had to pay higher and higher health insurance premiums. With nominal wages fixed in the short run, an increase in health insurance premiums paid by firms raises the cost of employing each worker. It affects the cost of production in the same way that higher wages would. The result of higher health insurance premiums is that firms will choose to employ fewer workers.</p>

                    <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s02_s02_s04_s02_p06">What were the causes of the U.S. recession of 2001? Economist Kevin Kliesen of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis points to four factors that, taken together, shifted the aggregate demand curve to the left and kept it there for a long enough period to keep real GDP falling for about nine months. They were the fall in stock market prices, the decrease in business investment both for computers and software and in structures, the decline in the real value of exports, and the aftermath of 9/11. Notable exceptions to this list of culprits were the behavior of consumer spending during the period and new residential housing, which falls into the investment category.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s02_s02_s04_s02_p07">During the expansion in the late 1990s, a surging stock market probably made it easier for firms to raise funding for investment in both structures and information technology. Even though the stock market bubble burst well before the actual recession, the continuation of projects already underway delayed the decline in the investment component of GDP. Also, spending for information technology was probably prolonged as firms dealt with Y2K computing issues, that is, computer problems associated with the change in the date from 1999 to 2000. Most computers used only two digits to indicate the year, and when the year changed from ’99 to ’00, computers did not know how to interpret the change, and extensive reprogramming of computers was required.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s02_s02_s04_s02_p08">Real exports fell during the recession because (1) the dollar was strong during the period and (2) real GDP growth in the rest of the world fell almost 5% from 2000 to 2001.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s02_s02_s04_s02_p09">Then, the terrorist attacks of 9/11, which literally shut down transportation and financial markets for several days, may have prolonged these negative tendencies just long enough to turn what might otherwise have been a mild decline into enough of a downtown to qualify the period as a recession.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s02_s02_s04_s02_p10">During this period the measured price level was essentially stable—with the implicit price deflator rising by less than 1%. Thus, while the aggregate demand curve shifted left as a result of all the reasons given above, there was also a leftward shift in the short-run aggregate supply curve.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s03_s03_s03_p02">Panel (a) gives a long-run perspective on the economy. It suggests that the economy generally operates at about potential output. In Panel (a), the gaps seem minor. Panel (b) gives a short-run perspective; the view it gives emphasizes the gaps. Both of these perspectives are important. While it is reassuring to see that the economy is often close to potential, the years in which there are substantial gaps have real effects: Inflation or unemployment can harm people.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s03_s03_s03_p03">Some economists argue that stabilization policy can and should be used when recessionary or inflationary gaps exist. Others urge reliance on the economy’s own ability to correct itself. They sometimes argue that the tools available to the public sector to influence aggregate demand are not likely to shift the curve, or they argue that the tools would shift the curve in a way that could do more harm than good.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s03_s03_s03_p04">Economists who advocate stabilization policies argue that prices are sufficiently sticky that the economy’s own adjustment to its potential will be a slow process—and a painful one. For an economy with a recessionary gap, unacceptably high levels of unemployment will persist for too long a time. For an economy with an inflationary gap, the increased prices that occur as the short-run aggregate supply curve shifts upward impose too high an inflation rate in the short run. These economists believe it is far preferable to use stabilization policy to shift the aggregate demand curve in an effort to shorten the time the economy is subject to a gap.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s03_s03_s03_p05">Economists who favor a nonintervention approach accept the notion that stabilization policy can shift the aggregate demand curve. They argue, however, that such efforts are not nearly as simple in the real world as they may appear on paper. For example, policies to change real GDP may not affect the economy for months or even years. By the time the impact of the stabilization policy occurs, the state of the economy might have changed. Policy makers might choose an expansionary policy when a contractionary one is needed or vice versa. Other economists who favor nonintervention also question how sticky prices really are and if gaps even exist.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s03_s03_s03_p06">The debate over how policy makers should respond to recessionary and inflationary gaps is an ongoing one. These issues of nonintervention versus stabilization policies lie at the heart of the macroeconomic policy debate. We will return to them as we continue our analysis of the determination of output and the price level.</p>

                    <li>When the aggregate demand and short-run aggregate supply curves intersect below potential output, the economy has a recessionary gap. When they intersect above potential output, the economy has an inflationary gap.</li>
                    <li>Inflationary and recessionary gaps are closed as the real wage returns to equilibrium, where the quantity of labor demanded equals the quantity supplied. Because of nominal wage and price stickiness, however, such an adjustment takes time.</li>
                    <li>When the economy has a gap, policy makers can choose to do nothing and let the economy return to potential output and the natural level of employment on its own. A policy to take no action to try to close a gap is a nonintervention policy.</li>
                    <li>Alternatively, policy makers can choose to try to close a gap by using stabilization policy. Stabilization policy designed to increase real GDP is called expansionary policy. Stabilization policy designed to decrease real GDP is called contractionary policy.</li>

                <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s03_s03_s03_p08">In an analysis that spans 66 countries over nearly eight centuries, economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff  investigate hundreds of financial crises and the economic busts each leaves in its wake. With a database that includes crisis episodes that go back as far as 12th-century China and medieval Europe and continue until the financial crisis of 2007–2008, the authors look at the patterns of economic behavior that characterize the periods leading up to financial crises and the patterns that characterize the recoveries.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s03_s03_s03_p09">They argue that looking over a long period of history is necessary because financial crises are “rare” events. Financial crises occur at varying intervals, and researchers studying a period of 25 years or so may not encounter the equivalent of a 100-year, category 5 hurricane that hits a major, low-lying city with a faulty levee system.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s03_s03_s03_p10">In general, such crises follow periods of relative economic calm. For example, the period in the United States from the mid-1980s until 2007 was often referred to as the Great Moderation. During such periods, inflationary and recessionary gaps may occur, but they are relatively small and short-lived. Societies begin to feel that they have tamed the business cycle, that policy makers have gotten smarter, and that moderation will continue.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s03_s03_s03_p11">But then it happens. The accumulation of too much debt by governments, businesses, or consumers leads to a financial meltdown. As housing prices are run up, for example, people tend to find ways to justify their heavy borrowing and to rationalize the ascent in prices: Demographics have changed; mortgage terms have improved; the regulation we have put in place is better this time; it’s better to buy now, before prices go up even more; housing prices won’t fall. Memories of the last crisis fade. “This time is different,” they argue.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s03_s03_s03_p12">But Reinhart and Rogoff provide convincing evidence that “this time” is usually not different. Large-scale debt buildups lead to crises of confidence, and a financial crisis ensues. The aftermath is typically a severe and prolonged recessionary gap. On average, they find the following to be true:</p>
                <ol class="orderedlist">
                    <li>The collapse in asset market prices is large and long-lasting. Housing prices decline an average of 35% over 6 years, and stock prices decline an average of 56% over 3.5 years.</li>
                    <li>Peak-to-trough GDP falls 9% on average, and the recession averages 2 years in length.</li>
                    <li>The unemployment rate rises 7 percentage points over a 4-year period.</li>
                    <li>Government debt swells due to bailout costs and, more importantly, because tax revenues fall off due to lower GDP.</li>
                    <li>V-shaped recoveries in stock prices are more common than V-shaped recoveries in housing prices or employment.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s03_s03_s03_p13">To what extent is the financial crisis of the late 2000s likely to follow this typical pattern? The authors argue that experience with expansionary fiscal policy in such circumstances is actually quite limited. Most often, governments are shut out of borrowing markets when crises hit. Japan’s government explicitly tried to implement fiscal stimulus, but the authors warn against drawing conclusions from one such example. The authors caution that governments should weigh any potential benefit of fiscal stimulus against the problem of higher public debt. They also note that central banks in 2007–2008 acted quickly and aggressively with expansionary monetary policies. But, they caution against “push[ing] too far the conceit that we are smarter than our predecessors” (p. 238). The global nature of the current situation only adds to the difficulty of recovering fully.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s03_s03_s03_p14">There was a company failure around 15 years ago that looked like a big deal at the time, but now seems like little more than a blip. The authors quote a trader who, during this event, presciently remarked, “More money has been lost because of four words than at the point of a gun. Those words are ‘This time is different.’”</p>

                <h3 class="title">Answer to Try It! Problem</h3>
                <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s03_s03_s03_p21">To the graph in the previous Try It! problem we add the long-run aggregate supply curve to show that, with output below potential, the U.S. economy in 1933 was in a recessionary gap. The unemployment rate was above the natural rate of unemployment. Indeed, real GDP in 1933 was about 30% below what it had been in 1929, and the unemployment rate had increased from 3% to 25%. Note that during the period of the Great Depression, wages did fall. The notion of nominal wage and other price stickiness discussed in this section should not be construed to mean complete wage and price inflexibility. Rather, during this period, nominal wages and other prices were not flexible enough to restore the economy to the potential level of output. There are two basic choices on how to close recessionary gaps. Nonintervention would mean waiting for wages to fall further. As wages fall, the short-run aggregate supply curve would continue to shift to the right. The alternative would be to use some type of expansionary policy. This would shift the aggregate demand curve to the right. These two options were illustrated in <a class="xref" href="#rittenmacro-ch07_s03_s03_s02_f01">Figure 7.15 "Alternatives in Closing an Inflationary Gap"</a>.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Summary</h3>
        <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s04_p01">In this chapter, we outlined the model of aggregate demand and aggregate supply. We saw that the aggregate demand curve slopes downward, reflecting the tendency for the aggregate quantity of goods and services demanded to rise as the price level falls and to fall as the price level rises. The negative relationship between the price level and the quantity of goods and services demanded results from the wealth effect for consumption, the interest rate effect for investment, and the international trade effect for net exports. We examined the factors that can shift the aggregate demand curve as well. Generally, the aggregate demand curve shifts by a multiple of the initial amount by which the component causing it to shift changes.</p>
        <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s04_p02">We distinguished between two types of equilibria in macroeconomics—one corresponding to the short run, a period of analysis in which nominal wages and some prices are sticky, and the other corresponding to the long run, a period in which full wage and price flexibility, and hence market adjustment, have been achieved. Long-run equilibrium occurs at the intersection of the aggregate demand curve with the long-run aggregate supply curve. The long-run aggregate supply curve is a vertical line at the economy’s potential level of output. Short-run equilibrium occurs at the intersection of the aggregate demand curve with the short-run aggregate supply curve. The short-run aggregate supply curve relates the quantity of total output produced to the price level in the short run. It is upward sloping because of wage and price stickiness. In short-run equilibrium, output can be below or above potential.</p>
        <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch07_s04_p03">If an economy is initially operating at its potential output, then a change in aggregate demand or short-run aggregate supply will induce a recessionary or inflationary gap. Such a gap will be closed in the long run by changes in the nominal wage, which will shift the short-run aggregate supply curve to the left (to close an inflationary gap) or to the right (to close a recessionary gap). Policy makers might respond to a recessionary or inflationary gap with a nonintervention policy, or they could use stabilization policy.</p>
