<span id="Detecting-Single_002dThreaded-Execution"></span><h4 class="subsubsection">35.2.2.4 Detecting Single-Threaded Execution</h4>

<p>Multi-threaded programs require synchronization among threads.  This
synchronization can be costly even if there is just a single thread
and no data is shared between multiple processors.  The GNU C Library offers
an interface to detect whether the process is in single-threaded mode.
Applications can use this information to avoid synchronization, for
example by using regular instructions to load and store memory instead
of atomic instructions, or using relaxed memory ordering instead of
stronger memory ordering.
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-_005f_005flibc_005fsingle_005fthreaded">Variable: <em>char</em> <strong>__libc_single_threaded</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This variable is non-zero if the current process is definitely
single-threaded.  If it is zero, the process may be multi-threaded,
or the GNU C Library cannot determine at this point of the program execution
whether the process is single-threaded or not.
</p>
<p>Applications must never write to this variable.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>Most applications should perform the same actions whether or not
<code>__libc_single_threaded</code> is true, except with less
synchronization.  If this rule is followed, a process that
subsequently becomes multi-threaded is already in a consistent state.
For example, in order to increment a reference count, the following
code can be used:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">if (__libc_single_threaded)
  atomic_fetch_add (&amp;reference_count, 1, memory_order_relaxed);
else
  atomic_fetch_add (&amp;reference_count, 1, memory_order_acq_rel);
</pre></div>


<p>This still requires some form of synchronization on the
single-threaded branch, so it can be beneficial not to declare the
reference count as <code>_Atomic</code>, and use the GCC <code>__atomic</code>
built-ins.  See <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/_005f_005fatomic-Builtins.html#g_t_005f_005fatomic-Builtins">Built-in Functions for Memory
Model Aware Atomic Operations</a> in <cite>Using the GNU Compiler Collection
(GCC)</cite>.  Then the code to increment a reference count looks like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">if (__libc_single_threaded)
  ++refeference_count;
else
  __atomic_fetch_add (&amp;reference_count, 1, __ATOMIC_ACQ_REL);
</pre></div>

<p>(Depending on the data associated with the reference count, it may be
possible to use the weaker <code>__ATOMIC_RELAXED</code> memory ordering on
the multi-threaded branch.)
</p>
<p>Several functions in the GNU C Library can change the value of the
<code>__libc_single_threaded</code> variable.  For example, creating new
threads using the <code>pthread_create</code> or <code>thrd_create</code> function
sets the variable to false.  This can also happen indirectly, say via
a call to <code>dlopen</code>.  Therefore, applications need to make a copy
of the value of <code>__libc_single_threaded</code> if after such a function
call, behavior must match the value as it was before the call, like
this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">bool single_threaded = __libc_single_threaded;
if (single_threaded)
  prepare_single_threaded ();
else
  prepare_multi_thread ();

void *handle = dlopen (shared_library_name, RTLD_NOW);
lookup_symbols (handle);

if (single_threaded)
  cleanup_single_threaded ();
else
  cleanup_multi_thread ();
</pre></div>

<p>Since the value of <code>__libc_single_threaded</code> can change from true
to false during the execution of the program, it is not useful for
selecting optimized function implementations in IFUNC resolvers.
</p>
<p>Atomic operations can also be used on mappings shared among
single-threaded processes.  This means that a compiler must not use
<code>__libc_single_threaded</code> to optimize atomic operations, unless it
is able to prove that the memory is not shared.
</p>
<p><strong>Implementation Note:</strong> The <code>__libc_single_threaded</code>
variable is not declared as <code>volatile</code> because it is expected
that compilers optimize a sequence of single-threaded checks into one
check, for example if several reference counts are updated.  The
current implementation in the GNU C Library does not set the
<code>__libc_single_threaded</code> variable to a true value if a process
turns single-threaded again.  Future versions of the GNU C Library may do
this, but only as the result of function calls which imply an acquire
(compiler) barrier.  (Some compilers assume that well-known functions
such as <code>malloc</code> do not write to global variables, and setting
<code>__libc_single_threaded</code> would introduce a data race and
undefined behavior.)  In any case, an application must not write to
<code>__libc_single_threaded</code> even if it has joined the last
application-created thread because future versions of the GNU C Library may
create background threads after the first thread has been created, and
the application has no way of knowning that these threads are present.
