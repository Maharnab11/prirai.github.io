<span id="File-Name-Resolution-1"></span><h4 class="subsection">11.2.2 File Name Resolution</h4>

<p>A file name consists of file name components separated by slash
(&lsquo;<samp>/</samp>&rsquo;) characters.  On the systems that the GNU C Library supports,
multiple successive &lsquo;<samp>/</samp>&rsquo; characters are equivalent to a single
&lsquo;<samp>/</samp>&rsquo; character.
</p>
<span id="index-file-name-resolution"></span>
<p>The process of determining what file a file name refers to is called
<em>file name resolution</em>.  This is performed by examining the
components that make up a file name in left-to-right order, and locating
each successive component in the directory named by the previous
component.  Of course, each of the files that are referenced as
directories must actually exist, be directories instead of regular
files, and have the appropriate permissions to be accessible by the
process; otherwise the file name resolution fails.
</p>
<span id="index-root-directory"></span>
<span id="index-absolute-file-name"></span>
<p>If a file name begins with a &lsquo;<samp>/</samp>&rsquo;, the first component in the file
name is located in the <em>root directory</em> of the process (usually all
processes on the system have the same root directory).  Such a file name
is called an <em>absolute file name</em>.
</p>
<span id="index-relative-file-name"></span>
<p>Otherwise, the first component in the file name is located in the
current working directory (see <a href="Working-Directory.html">Working Directory</a>).  This kind of
file name is called a <em>relative file name</em>.
</p>
<span id="index-parent-directory"></span>
<p>The file name components <samp>.</samp> (&ldquo;dot&rdquo;) and <samp>..</samp> (&ldquo;dot-dot&rdquo;)
have special meanings.  Every directory has entries for these file name
components.  The file name component <samp>.</samp> refers to the directory
itself, while the file name component <samp>..</samp> refers to its
<em>parent directory</em> (the directory that contains the link for the
directory in question).  As a special case, <samp>..</samp> in the root
directory refers to the root directory itself, since it has no parent;
thus <samp>/..</samp> is the same as <samp>/</samp>.
</p>
<p>Here are some examples of file names:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><samp>/a</samp></dt>
<dd><p>The file named <samp>a</samp>, in the root directory.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>/a/b</samp></dt>
<dd><p>The file named <samp>b</samp>, in the directory named <samp>a</samp> in the root directory.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>a</samp></dt>
<dd><p>The file named <samp>a</samp>, in the current working directory.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>/a/./b</samp></dt>
<dd><p>This is the same as <samp>/a/b</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>./a</samp></dt>
<dd><p>The file named <samp>a</samp>, in the current working directory.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>../a</samp></dt>
<dd><p>The file named <samp>a</samp>, in the parent directory of the current working
directory.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>A file name that names a directory may optionally end in a &lsquo;<samp>/</samp>&rsquo;.
You can specify a file name of <samp>/</samp> to refer to the root directory,
but the empty string is not a meaningful file name.  If you want to
refer to the current working directory, use a file name of <samp>.</samp> or
<samp>./</samp>.
</p>
<p>Unlike some other operating systems, GNU systems don&rsquo;t have any
built-in support for file types (or extensions) or file versions as part
of its file name syntax.  Many programs and utilities use conventions
for file names&mdash;for example, files containing C source code usually
have names suffixed with &lsquo;<samp>.c</samp>&rsquo;&mdash;but there is nothing in the file
system itself that enforces this kind of convention.
