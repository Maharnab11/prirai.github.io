<span id="Unsafe-Features-1"></span><h4 class="subsubsection">1.2.2.2 Unsafe Features</h4>
<span id="index-Unsafe-Features"></span>

<p>Functions that are unsafe to call in certain contexts are annotated with
keywords that document their features that make them unsafe to call.
AS-Unsafe features in this section indicate the functions are never safe
to call when asynchronous signals are enabled.  AC-Unsafe features
indicate they are never safe to call when asynchronous cancellation is
enabled.  There are no MT-Unsafe marks in this section.
</p>
<ul>
<li> <code>lock</code>
<span id="index-lock"></span>

<p>Functions marked with <code>lock</code> as an AS-Unsafe feature may be
interrupted by a signal while holding a non-recursive lock.  If the
signal handler calls another such function that takes the same lock, the
result is a deadlock.
</p>
<p>Functions annotated with <code>lock</code> as an AC-Unsafe feature may, if
cancelled asynchronously, fail to release a lock that would have been
released if their execution had not been interrupted by asynchronous
thread cancellation.  Once a lock is left taken, attempts to take that
lock will block indefinitely.
</p>

</li><li> <code>corrupt</code>
<span id="index-corrupt"></span>

<p>Functions marked with <code>corrupt</code> as an AS-Unsafe feature may corrupt
data structures and misbehave when they interrupt, or are interrupted
by, another such function.  Unlike functions marked with <code>lock</code>,
these take recursive locks to avoid MT-Safety problems, but this is not
enough to stop a signal handler from observing a partially-updated data
structure.  Further corruption may arise from the interrupted function&rsquo;s
failure to notice updates made by signal handlers.
</p>
<p>Functions marked with <code>corrupt</code> as an AC-Unsafe feature may leave
data structures in a corrupt, partially updated state.  Subsequent uses
of the data structure may misbehave.
</p>


</li><li> <code>heap</code>
<span id="index-heap"></span>

<p>Functions marked with <code>heap</code> may call heap memory management
functions from the <code>malloc</code>/<code>free</code> family of functions and are
only as safe as those functions.  This note is thus equivalent to:
</p>
<p>| AS-Unsafe lock
| AC-Unsafe lock fd mem
|
</p>



</li><li> <code>dlopen</code>
<span id="index-dlopen"></span>

<p>Functions marked with <code>dlopen</code> use the dynamic loader to load
shared libraries into the current execution image.  This involves
opening files, mapping them into memory, allocating additional memory,
resolving symbols, applying relocations and more, all of this while
holding internal dynamic loader locks.
</p>
<p>The locks are enough for these functions to be AS- and AC-Unsafe, but
other issues may arise.  At present this is a placeholder for all
potential safety issues raised by <code>dlopen</code>.
</p>


</li><li> <code>plugin</code>
<span id="index-plugin"></span>

<p>Functions annotated with <code>plugin</code> may run code from plugins that
may be external to the GNU C Library.  Such plugin functions are assumed to be
MT-Safe, AS-Unsafe and AC-Unsafe.  Examples of such plugins are stack
<span id="index-NSS"></span>
unwinding libraries, name service switch (NSS) and character set
<span id="index-iconv"></span>
conversion (iconv) back-ends.
</p>
<p>Although the plugins mentioned as examples are all brought in by means
of dlopen, the <code>plugin</code> keyword does not imply any direct
involvement of the dynamic loader or the <code>libdl</code> interfaces, those
are covered by <code>dlopen</code>.  For example, if one function loads a
module and finds the addresses of some of its functions, while another
just calls those already-resolved functions, the former will be marked
with <code>dlopen</code>, whereas the latter will get the <code>plugin</code>.  When
a single function takes all of these actions, then it gets both marks.
</p>

</li><li> <code>i18n</code>
<span id="index-i18n"></span>

<p>Functions marked with <code>i18n</code> may call internationalization
functions of the <code>gettext</code> family and will be only as safe as those
functions.  This note is thus equivalent to:
</p>
<p>| MT-Safe env
| AS-Unsafe corrupt heap dlopen
| AC-Unsafe corrupt
|
</p>



</li><li> <code>timer</code>
<span id="index-timer"></span>

<p>Functions marked with <code>timer</code> use the <code>alarm</code> function or
similar to set a time-out for a system call or a long-running operation.
In a multi-threaded program, there is a risk that the time-out signal
will be delivered to a different thread, thus failing to interrupt the
intended thread.  Besides being MT-Unsafe, such functions are always
AS-Unsafe, because calling them in signal handlers may interfere with
timers set in the interrupted code, and AC-Unsafe, because there is no
safe way to guarantee an earlier timer will be reset in case of
asynchronous cancellation.
</p>
</li></ul>
