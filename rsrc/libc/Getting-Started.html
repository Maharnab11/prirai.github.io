<p>This manual is written with the assumption that you are at least
somewhat familiar with the C programming language and basic programming
concepts.  Specifically, familiarity with ISO standard C
(see <a href="ISO-C.html">ISO C</a>), rather than &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; pre-ISO C dialects, is
assumed.
</p>
<p>The GNU C Library includes several <em>header files</em>, each of which
provides definitions and declarations for a group of related facilities;
this information is used by the C compiler when processing your program.
For example, the header file <samp>stdio.h</samp> declares facilities for
performing input and output, and the header file <samp>string.h</samp>
declares string processing utilities.  The organization of this manual
generally follows the same division as the header files.
</p>
<p>If you are reading this manual for the first time, you should read all
of the introductory material and skim the remaining chapters.  There are
a <em>lot</em> of functions in the GNU C Library and it&rsquo;s not realistic to
expect that you will be able to remember exactly <em>how</em> to use each
and every one of them.  It&rsquo;s more important to become generally familiar
with the kinds of facilities that the library provides, so that when you
are writing your programs you can recognize <em>when</em> to make use of
library functions, and <em>where</em> in this manual you can find more
specific information about them.
