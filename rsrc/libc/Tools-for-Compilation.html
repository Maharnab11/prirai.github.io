<span id="index-installation-tools"></span>
<span id="index-tools_002c-for-installing-library"></span>

<p>We recommend installing the following GNU tools before attempting to
build the GNU C Library:
</p>
<ul>
<li> GNU <code>make</code> 4.0 or newer

<p>As of relase time, GNU <code>make</code> 4.2.1 is the newest verified to work
to build the GNU C Library.
</p>
</li><li> GCC 6.2 or newer

<p>GCC 6.2 or higher is required.  In general it is recommended to use
the newest version of the compiler that is known to work for building
the GNU C Library, as newer compilers usually produce better code.  As of
release time, GCC 9.2.1 is the newest compiler verified to work to build
the GNU C Library.
</p>
<p>For PowerPC 64-bits little-endian (powerpc64le), a GCC version with support
for <samp>-mno-gnu-attribute</samp>, <samp>-mabi=ieeelongdouble</samp>, and
<samp>-mabi=ibmlondouble</samp> is required.  Likewise, the compiler must also
support passing <samp>-mlong-double-128</samp> with the preceding options.  As
of release, this implies GCC 7.4 and newer (excepting GCC 7.5.0, see GCC
PR94200).  These additional features are required for building the GNU C
Library with support for IEEE long double.
</p>

<p>For ARC architecture builds, GCC 8.3 or higher is needed.
</p>
<p>For multi-arch support it is recommended to use a GCC which has been built with
support for GNU indirect functions.  This ensures that correct debugging
information is generated for functions selected by IFUNC resolvers.  This
support can either be enabled by configuring GCC with
&lsquo;<samp>--enable-gnu-indirect-function</samp>&rsquo;, or by enabling it by default by setting
&lsquo;<samp>default_gnu_indirect_function</samp>&rsquo; variable for a particular architecture in
the GCC source file <samp>gcc/config.gcc</samp>.
</p>
<p>You can use whatever compiler you like to compile programs that use
the GNU C Library.
</p>
<p>Check the FAQ for any special compiler issues on particular platforms.
</p>
</li><li> GNU <code>binutils</code> 2.25 or later

<p>You must use GNU <code>binutils</code> (as and ld) to build the GNU C Library.
No other assembler or linker has the necessary functionality at the
moment. As of release time, GNU <code>binutils</code> 2.32 is the newest
verified to work to build the GNU C Library.
</p>
<p>For PowerPC 64-bits little-endian (powerpc64le), <code>objcopy</code> is required
to support <samp>--update-section</samp>.  This option requires binutils 2.26 or
newer.
</p>
<p>ARC architecture needs <code>binutils</code> 2.32 or higher for TLS related fixes.
</p>
</li><li> GNU <code>texinfo</code> 4.7 or later

<p>To correctly translate and install the Texinfo documentation you need
this version of the <code>texinfo</code> package.  Earlier versions do not
understand all the tags used in the document, and the installation
mechanism for the info files is not present or works differently.
As of release time, <code>texinfo</code> 6.6 is the newest verified to work
to build the GNU C Library.
</p>
</li><li> GNU <code>awk</code> 3.1.2, or higher

<p><code>awk</code> is used in several places to generate files.
Some <code>gawk</code> extensions are used, including the <code>asorti</code>
function, which was introduced in version 3.1.2 of <code>gawk</code>.
As of release time, <code>gawk</code> version 5.0.1 is the newest verified
to work to build the GNU C Library.
</p>
</li><li> GNU <code>bison</code> 2.7 or later

<p><code>bison</code> is used to generate the <code>yacc</code> parser code in the <samp>intl</samp>
subdirectory.  As of release time, <code>bison</code> version 3.4.1 is the newest
verified to work to build the GNU C Library.
</p>
</li><li> Perl 5

<p>Perl is not required, but if present it is used in some tests and the
<code>mtrace</code> program, to build the GNU C Library manual.  As of release
time <code>perl</code> version 5.30.1 is the newest verified to work to
build the GNU C Library.
</p>
</li><li> GNU <code>sed</code> 3.02 or newer

<p><code>Sed</code> is used in several places to generate files.  Most scripts work
with any version of <code>sed</code>.  As of release time, <code>sed</code> version
4.5 is the newest verified to work to build the GNU C Library.
</p>
</li><li> Python 3.4 or later

<p>Python is required to build the GNU C Library.  As of release time, Python
3.7.4 is the newest verified to work for building and testing
the GNU C Library.
</p>
</li><li> PExpect 4.0

<p>The pretty printer tests drive GDB through test programs and compare
its output to the printers&rsquo;.  PExpect is used to capture the output of
GDB, and should be compatible with the Python version in your system.
As of release time PExpect 4.3 is the newest verified to work to test
the pretty printers.
</p>
</li><li> GDB 7.8 or later with support for Python 2.7/3.4 or later

<p>GDB itself needs to be configured with Python support in order to use
the pretty printers.  Notice that your system having Python available
doesn&rsquo;t imply that GDB supports it, nor that your system&rsquo;s Python and
GDB&rsquo;s have the same version.  As of release time GNU <code>debugger</code>
8.3 is the newest verified to work to test the pretty printers.
</p>
<p>Unless Python, PExpect and GDB with Python support are present, the
printer tests will report themselves as <code>UNSUPPORTED</code>.  Notice
that some of the printer tests require the GNU C Library to be compiled with
debugging symbols.
</p></li></ul>

<p>If you change any of the <samp>configure.ac</samp> files you will also need
</p>
<ul>
<li> GNU <code>autoconf</code> 2.69 (exactly)
</li></ul>

<p>and if you change any of the message translation files you will need
</p>
<ul>
<li> GNU <code>gettext</code> 0.10.36 or later

<p>As of release time, GNU <code>gettext</code> version 0.19.8.1 is the newest
version verified to work to build the GNU C Library.
</p></li></ul>


<p>You may also need these packages if you upgrade your source tree using
patches, although we try to avoid this.
