<span id="index-memory-protection"></span>
<span id="index-page-protection"></span>
<span id="index-protection-flags"></span>

<p>When a page is mapped using <code>mmap</code>, page protection flags can be
specified using the protection flags argument.  See <a href="Memory_002dmapped-I_002fO.html">Memory-mapped I/O</a>.
</p>
<p>The following flags are available:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>PROT_WRITE</code>
<span id="index-PROT_005fWRITE"></span>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>The memory can be written to.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>PROT_READ</code>
<span id="index-PROT_005fREAD"></span>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>The memory can be read.  On some architectures, this flag implies that
the memory can be executed as well (as if <code>PROT_EXEC</code> had been
specified at the same time).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>PROT_EXEC</code>
<span id="index-PROT_005fEXEC"></span>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>The memory can be used to store instructions which can then be executed.
On most architectures, this flag implies that the memory can be read (as
if <code>PROT_READ</code> had been specified).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>PROT_NONE</code>
<span id="index-PROT_005fNONE"></span>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This flag must be specified on its own.
</p>
<p>The memory is reserved, but cannot be read, written, or executed.  If
this flag is specified in a call to <code>mmap</code>, a virtual memory area
will be set aside for future use in the process, and <code>mmap</code> calls
without the <code>MAP_FIXED</code> flag will not use it for subsequent
allocations.  For anonymous mappings, the kernel will not reserve any
physical memory for the allocation at the time the mapping is created.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>The operating system may keep track of these flags separately even if
the underlying hardware treats them the same for the purposes of access
checking (as happens with <code>PROT_READ</code> and <code>PROT_EXEC</code> on some
platforms).  On GNU systems, <code>PROT_EXEC</code> always implies
<code>PROT_READ</code>, so that users can view the machine code which is
executing on their system.
</p>
<p>Inappropriate access will cause a segfault (see <a href="Program-Error-Signals.html">Program Error Signals</a>).
</p>
<p>After allocation, protection flags can be changed using the
<code>mprotect</code> function.
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-mprotect">Function: <em>int</em> <strong>mprotect</strong> <em>(void *<var>address</var>, size_t <var>length</var>, int <var>protection</var>)</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Preliminary:
| MT-Safe 
| AS-Safe 
| AC-Safe 
| See <a href="POSIX-Safety-Concepts.html">POSIX Safety Concepts</a>.
</p>


<p>A successful call to the <code>mprotect</code> function changes the protection
flags of at least <var>length</var> bytes of memory, starting at
<var>address</var>.
</p>
<p><var>address</var> must be aligned to the page size for the mapping.  The
system page size can be obtained by calling <code>sysconf</code> with the
<code>_SC_PAGESIZE</code> parameter (see <a href="Sysconf-Definition.html">Sysconf Definition</a>).  The system
page size is the granularity in which the page protection of anonymous
memory mappings and most file mappings can be changed.  Memory which is
mapped from special files or devices may have larger page granularity
than the system page size and may require larger alignment.
</p>
<p><var>length</var> is the number of bytes whose protection flags must be
changed.  It is automatically rounded up to the next multiple of the
system page size.
</p>
<p><var>protection</var> is a combination of the <code>PROT_*</code> flags described
above.
</p>
<p>The <code>mprotect</code> function returns <em>0</em> on success and <em>-1</em>
on failure.
</p>
<p>The following <code>errno</code> error conditions are defined for this
function:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>ENOMEM</code></dt>
<dd><p>The system was not able to allocate resources to fulfill the request.
This can happen if there is not enough physical memory in the system for
the allocation of backing storage.  The error can also occur if the new
protection flags would cause the memory region to be split from its
neighbors, and the process limit for the number of such distinct memory
regions would be exceeded.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>EINVAL</code></dt>
<dd><p><var>address</var> is not properly aligned to a page boundary for the
mapping, or <var>length</var> (after rounding up to the system page size) is
not a multiple of the applicable page size for the mapping, or the
combination of flags in <var>protection</var> is not valid.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>EACCES</code></dt>
<dd><p>The file for a file-based mapping was not opened with open flags which
are compatible with <var>protection</var>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>EPERM</code></dt>
<dd><p>The system security policy does not allow a mapping with the specified
flags.  For example, mappings which are both <code>PROT_EXEC</code> and
<code>PROT_WRITE</code> at the same time might not be allowed.
</p></dd>
</dl>
</dd></dl>

<p>If the <code>mprotect</code> function is used to make a region of memory
inaccessible by specifying the <code>PROT_NONE</code> protection flag and
access is later restored, the memory retains its previous contents.
</p>
<p>On some systems, it may not be possible to specify additional flags
which were not present when the mapping was first created.  For example,
an attempt to make a region of memory executable could fail if the
initial protection flags were &lsquo;<samp>PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>In general, the <code>mprotect</code> function can be used to change any
process memory, no matter how it was allocated.  However, portable use
of the function requires that it is only used with memory regions
returned by <code>mmap</code> or <code>mmap64</code>.
</p>
<span id="Memory-Protection-Keys"></span><h4 class="subsection">3.4.1 Memory Protection Keys</h4>

<span id="index-memory-protection-key"></span>
<span id="index-protection-key"></span>
<span id="index-MPK"></span>
<p>On some systems, further restrictions can be added to specific pages
using <em>memory protection keys</em>.  These restrictions work as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li> All memory pages are associated with a protection key.  The default
protection key does not cause any additional protections to be applied
during memory accesses.  New keys can be allocated with the
<code>pkey_alloc</code> function, and applied to pages using
<code>pkey_mprotect</code>.

</li><li> Each thread has a set of separate access right restriction for each
protection key.  These access rights can be manipulated using the
<code>pkey_set</code> and <code>pkey_get</code> functions.

</li><li> During a memory access, the system obtains the protection key for the
accessed page and uses that to determine the applicable access rights,
as configured for the current thread.  If the access is restricted, a
segmentation fault is the result ((see <a href="Program-Error-Signals.html">Program Error Signals</a>).
These checks happen in addition to the <code>PROT_</code>* protection flags
set by <code>mprotect</code> or <code>pkey_mprotect</code>.
</li></ul>

<p>New threads and subprocesses inherit the access rights of the current
thread.  If a protection key is allocated subsequently, existing threads
(except the current) will use an unspecified system default for the
access rights associated with newly allocated keys.
</p>
<p>Upon entering a signal handler, the system resets the access rights of
the current thread so that pages with the default key can be accessed,
but the access rights for other protection keys are unspecified.
</p>
<p>Applications are expected to allocate a key once using
<code>pkey_alloc</code>, and apply the key to memory regions which need
special protection with <code>pkey_mprotect</code>:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">  int key = pkey_alloc (0, PKEY_DISABLE_ACCESS);
  if (key &lt; 0)
    /* Perform error checking, including fallback for lack of support.  */
    ...;

  /* Apply the key to a special memory region used to store critical
     data.  */
  if (pkey_mprotect (region, region_length,
                     PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, key) &lt; 0)
    ...; /* Perform error checking (generally fatal).  */
</pre></div>

<p>If the key allocation fails due to lack of support for memory protection
keys, the <code>pkey_mprotect</code> call can usually be skipped.  In this
case, the region will not be protected by default.  It is also possible
to call <code>pkey_mprotect</code> with a key value of <em>-1</em>, in which
case it will behave in the same way as <code>mprotect</code>.
</p>
<p>After key allocation assignment to memory pages, <code>pkey_set</code> can be
used to temporarily acquire access to the memory region and relinquish
it again:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">  if (key &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; pkey_set (key, 0) &lt; 0)
    ...; /* Perform error checking (generally fatal).  */
  /* At this point, the current thread has read-write access to the
     memory region.  */
  ...
  /* Revoke access again.  */
  if (key &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; pkey_set (key, PKEY_DISABLE_ACCESS) &lt; 0)
    ...; /* Perform error checking (generally fatal).  */
</pre></div>

<p>In this example, a negative key value indicates that no key had been
allocated, which means that the system lacks support for memory
protection keys and it is not necessary to change the the access rights
of the current thread (because it always has access).
</p>
<p>Compared to using <code>mprotect</code> to change the page protection flags,
this approach has two advantages: It is thread-safe in the sense that
the access rights are only changed for the current thread, so another
thread which changes its own access rights concurrently to gain access
to the mapping will not suddenly see its access rights revoked.  And
<code>pkey_set</code> typically does not involve a call into the kernel and a
context switch, so it is more efficient.

<p>Allocate a new protection key.  The <var>flags</var> argument is reserved and
must be zero.  The <var>restrictions</var> argument specifies access rights
which are applied to the current thread (as if with <code>pkey_set</code>
below).  Access rights of other threads are not changed.
</p>
<p>The function returns the new protection key, a non-negative number, or
<em>-1</em> on error.
</p>
<p>The following <code>errno</code> error conditions are defined for this

</p>
<dl compact="compact">

<p>Deallocate the protection key, so that it can be reused by

<p>Calling this function does not change the access rights of the freed

<p>Similar to <code>mprotect</code>, but also set the memory protection key for
the memory region to <code>key</code>.
</p>
<p>Some systems use memory protection keys to emulate certain combinations
of <var>protection</var> flags.  Under such circumstances, specifying an
explicit protection key may behave as if additional flags have been
specified in <var>protection</var>, even though this does not happen with the
default protection key.  For example, some systems can support
<code>PROT_EXEC</code>-only mappings only with a default protection key, and
memory with a key which was allocated using <code>pkey_alloc</code> will still
be readable if <code>PROT_EXEC</code> is specified without <code>PROT_READ</code>.
</p>
<p>If <var>key</var> is <em>-1</em>, the default protection key is applied to the
mapping, just as if <code>mprotect</code> had been called.
</p>
<p>The <code>pkey_mprotect</code> function returns <em>0</em> on success and
<em>-1</em> on failure.  The same <code>errno</code> error conditions as for
<code>mprotect</code> are defined for this function, with the following
addition:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>EINVAL</code></dt>
<dd><p>The <var>key</var> argument is not <em>-1</em> or a valid memory protection
key allocated using <code>pkey_alloc</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>ENOSYS</code></dt>
<dd><p>The system does not implement memory protection keys, and <var>key</var> is
not <em>-1</em>.
</p></dd>
</dl>
</dd></dl>

</p>

<p>Change the access rights of the current thread for memory pages with the
protection key <var>key</var> to <var>rights</var>.  If <var>rights</var> is zero, no
additional access restrictions on top of the page protection flags are
applied.  Otherwise, <var>rights</var> is a combination of the following
flags:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>PKEY_DISABLE_WRITE</code>
<span id="index-PKEY_005fDISABLE_005fWRITE"></span>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Subsequent attempts to write to memory with the specified protection
key will fault.
</p>

<dt><code>PKEY_DISABLE_ACCESS</code>
<span id="index-PKEY_005fDISABLE_005fACCESS"></span>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Subsequent attempts to write to or read from memory with the specified
protection key will fault.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Operations not specified as flags are not restricted.  In particular,
this means that the memory region will remain executable if it was
mapped with the <code>PROT_EXEC</code> protection flag and
<code>PKEY_DISABLE_ACCESS</code> has been specified.
</p>
<p>Calling the <code>pkey_set</code> function with a protection key which was not
allocated by <code>pkey_alloc</code> results in undefined behavior.  This
means that calling this function on systems which do not support memory
protection keys is undefined.
</p>
<p>The <code>pkey_set</code> function returns <em>0</em> on success and <em>-1</em>
on failure.
</p>
<p>The following <code>errno</code> error conditions are defined for this
function:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
