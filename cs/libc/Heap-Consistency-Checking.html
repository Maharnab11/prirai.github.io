<span id="index-heap-consistency-checking"></span>
<span id="index-consistency-checking_002c-of-heap"></span>

<p>You can ask <code>malloc</code> to check the consistency of dynamic memory by
using the <code>mcheck</code> function.  This function is a GNU extension,
declared in <samp>mcheck.h</samp>.
<span id="index-mcheck_002eh"></span>
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-mcheck">Function: <em>int</em> <strong>mcheck</strong> <em>(void (*<var>abortfn</var>) (enum mcheck_status <var>status</var>))</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Preliminary:
| MT-Unsafe race:mcheck const:malloc_hooks
| AS-Unsafe corrupt
| AC-Unsafe corrupt
| See <a href="POSIX-Safety-Concepts.html">POSIX Safety Concepts</a>.
</p>


<p>Calling <code>mcheck</code> tells <code>malloc</code> to perform occasional
consistency checks.  These will catch things such as writing
past the end of a block that was allocated with <code>malloc</code>.
</p>
<p>The <var>abortfn</var> argument is the function to call when an inconsistency
is found.  If you supply a null pointer, then <code>mcheck</code> uses a
default function which prints a message and calls <code>abort</code>
(see <a href="Aborting-a-Program.html">Aborting a Program</a>).  The function you supply is called with
one argument, which says what sort of inconsistency was detected; its
type is described below.
</p>
<p>It is too late to begin allocation checking once you have allocated
anything with <code>malloc</code>.  So <code>mcheck</code> does nothing in that
case.  The function returns <code>-1</code> if you call it too late, and
<code>0</code> otherwise (when it is successful).
</p>
<p>The easiest way to arrange to call <code>mcheck</code> early enough is to use
the option &lsquo;<samp>-lmcheck</samp>&rsquo; when you link your program; then you don&rsquo;t
need to modify your program source at all.  Alternatively you might use
a debugger to insert a call to <code>mcheck</code> whenever the program is
started, for example these gdb commands will automatically call <code>mcheck</code>
whenever the program starts:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(gdb) break main
Breakpoint 1, main (argc=2, argv=0xbffff964) at whatever.c:10
(gdb) command 1
Type commands for when breakpoint 1 is hit, one per line.
End with a line saying just &quot;end&quot;.
&gt;call mcheck(0)
&gt;continue
&gt;end
(gdb) &hellip;
</pre></div>

<p>This will however only work if no initialization function of any object
involved calls any of the <code>malloc</code> functions since <code>mcheck</code>
must be called before the first such function.
</p>
</dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-mprobe">Function: <em>enum mcheck_status</em> <strong>mprobe</strong> <em>(void *<var>pointer</var>)</em></dt>
<dd><p>Preliminary:
| MT-Unsafe race:mcheck const:malloc_hooks
| AS-Unsafe corrupt
| AC-Unsafe corrupt
| See <a href="POSIX-Safety-Concepts.html">POSIX Safety Concepts</a>.
</p>


<p>The <code>mprobe</code> function lets you explicitly check for inconsistencies
in a particular allocated block.  You must have already called
<code>mcheck</code> at the beginning of the program, to do its occasional
checks; calling <code>mprobe</code> requests an additional consistency check
to be done at the time of the call.
</p>
<p>The argument <var>pointer</var> must be a pointer returned by <code>malloc</code>
or <code>realloc</code>.  <code>mprobe</code> returns a value that says what
inconsistency, if any, was found.  The values are described below.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-enum-mcheck_005fstatus">Data Type: <strong>enum mcheck_status</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This enumerated type describes what kind of inconsistency was detected
in an allocated block, if any.  Here are the possible values:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>MCHECK_DISABLED</code></dt>
<dd><p><code>mcheck</code> was not called before the first allocation.
No consistency checking can be done.
</p></dd>
<dt><code>MCHECK_OK</code></dt>
<dd><p>No inconsistency detected.
</p></dd>
<dt><code>MCHECK_HEAD</code></dt>
<dd><p>The data immediately before the block was modified.
This commonly happens when an array index or pointer
is decremented too far.
</p></dd>
<dt><code>MCHECK_TAIL</code></dt>
<dd><p>The data immediately after the block was modified.
This commonly happens when an array index or pointer
is incremented too far.
</p></dd>
<dt><code>MCHECK_FREE</code></dt>
<dd><p>The block was already freed.
</p></dd>
</dl>
</dd></dl>

<p>Another possibility to check for and guard against bugs in the use of
<code>malloc</code>, <code>realloc</code> and <code>free</code> is to set the environment
variable <code>MALLOC_CHECK_</code>.  When <code>MALLOC_CHECK_</code> is set to a
non-zero value, a special (less efficient) implementation is used which
is designed to be tolerant against simple errors, such as double calls
of <code>free</code> with the same argument, or overruns of a single byte
(off-by-one bugs).  Not all such errors can be protected against,
however, and memory leaks can result.
</p>
<p>Any detected heap corruption results in immediate termination of the
process.
</p>
<p>There is one problem with <code>MALLOC_CHECK_</code>: in SUID or SGID binaries
it could possibly be exploited since diverging from the normal programs
behavior it now writes something to the standard error descriptor.
Therefore the use of <code>MALLOC_CHECK_</code> is disabled by default for
SUID and SGID binaries.  It can be enabled again by the system
administrator by adding a file <samp>/etc/suid-debug</samp> (the content is
not important it could be empty).
</p>
<p>So, what&rsquo;s the difference between using <code>MALLOC_CHECK_</code> and linking
with &lsquo;<samp>-lmcheck</samp>&rsquo;?  <code>MALLOC_CHECK_</code> is orthogonal with respect to
&lsquo;<samp>-lmcheck</samp>&rsquo;.  &lsquo;<samp>-lmcheck</samp>&rsquo; has been added for backward
compatibility.  Both <code>MALLOC_CHECK_</code> and &lsquo;<samp>-lmcheck</samp>&rsquo; should
uncover the same bugs - but using <code>MALLOC_CHECK_</code> you don&rsquo;t need to
recompile your application.
