<p>Because memory in obstack chunks is used sequentially, it is possible to
build up an object step by step, adding one or more bytes at a time to the
end of the object.  With this technique, you do not need to know how much
data you will put in the object until you come to the end of it.  We call
this the technique of <em>growing objects</em>.  The special functions
for adding data to the growing object are described in this section.
</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to do anything special when you start to grow an object.
Using one of the functions to add data to the object automatically
starts it.  However, it is necessary to say explicitly when the object is
finished.  This is done with the function <code>obstack_finish</code>.
</p>
<p>The actual address of the object thus built up is not known until the
object is finished.  Until then, it always remains possible that you will
add so much data that the object must be copied into a new chunk.
</p>
<p>While the obstack is in use for a growing object, you cannot use it for
ordinary allocation of another object.  If you try to do so, the space
already added to the growing object will become part of the other object.

</p>

<p>The most basic function for adding to a growing object is
<code>obstack_blank</code>, which adds space without initializing it.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-obstack_005fgrow">Function: <em>void</em> <strong>obstack_grow</strong> <em>(struct obstack *<var>obstack-ptr</var>, void *<var>data</var>, int <var>size</var>)</em></dt>

| AS-Safe 
| AC-Unsafe corrupt mem
| See <a href="POSIX-Safety-Concepts.html">POSIX Safety Concepts</a>.
</p>

<p>To add a block of initialized space, use <code>obstack_grow</code>, which is
the growing-object analogue of <code>obstack_copy</code>.  It adds <var>size</var>
bytes of data to the growing object, copying the contents from
<var>data</var>.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-obstack_005fgrow0">Function: <em>void</em> <strong>obstack_grow0</strong> <em>(struct obstack *<var>obstack-ptr</var>, void *<var>data</var>, int <var>size</var>)</em></dt>

<p>Preliminary:
| MT-Safe race:obstack-ptr
| AS-Safe 
| AC-Unsafe corrupt mem
| See <a href="POSIX-Safety-Concepts.html">POSIX Safety Concepts</a>.
</p>

<p>This is the growing-object analogue of <code>obstack_copy0</code>.  It adds
<var>size</var> bytes copied from <var>data</var>, followed by an additional null
character.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-obstack_005f1grow">Function: <em>void</em> <strong>obstack_1grow</strong> <em>(struct obstack *<var>obstack-ptr</var>, char <var>c</var>)</em></dt>

<p>Preliminary:
| MT-Safe race:obstack-ptr
| AS-Safe 
| AC-Unsafe corrupt mem
| See <a href="POSIX-Safety-Concepts.html">POSIX Safety Concepts</a>.
</p>

<p>To add one character at a time, use the function <code>obstack_1grow</code>.
It adds a single byte containing <var>c</var> to the growing object.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-obstack_005fptr_005fgrow">Function: <em>void</em> <strong>obstack_ptr_grow</strong> <em>(struct obstack *<var>obstack-ptr</var>, void *<var>data</var>)</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Preliminary:
| MT-Safe race:obstack-ptr
| AS-Safe 
| AC-Unsafe corrupt mem
| See <a href="POSIX-Safety-Concepts.html">POSIX Safety Concepts</a>.
</p>

<p>Adding the value of a pointer one can use the function
<code>obstack_ptr_grow</code>.  It adds <code>sizeof (void *)</code> bytes
containing the value of <var>data</var>.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-obstack_005fint_005fgrow">Function: <em>void</em> <strong>obstack_int_grow</strong> <em>(struct obstack *<var>obstack-ptr</var>, int <var>data</var>)</em></dt>

<p>Preliminary:
| MT-Safe race:obstack-ptr
| AS-Safe 
| AC-Unsafe corrupt mem
| See <a href="POSIX-Safety-Concepts.html">POSIX Safety Concepts</a>.
</p>

<p>A single value of type <code>int</code> can be added by using the
<code>obstack_int_grow</code> function.  It adds <code>sizeof (int)</code> bytes to
the growing object and initializes them with the value of <var>data</var>.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-obstack_005ffinish">Function: <em>void *</em> <strong>obstack_finish</strong> <em>(struct obstack *<var>obstack-ptr</var>)</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Preliminary:
| MT-Safe race:obstack-ptr
| AS-Safe 
| AC-Unsafe corrupt
| See <a href="POSIX-Safety-Concepts.html">POSIX Safety Concepts</a>.
</p>

<p>When you are finished growing the object, use the function
<code>obstack_finish</code> to close it off and return its final address.
</p>
<p>Once you have finished the object, the obstack is available for ordinary
allocation or for growing another object.
</p>
<p>This function can return a null pointer under the same conditions as
<code>obstack_alloc</code> (see <a href="Allocation-in-an-Obstack.html">Allocation in an Obstack</a>).
</p></dd></dl>

<p>When you build an object by growing it, you will probably need to know
afterward how long it became.  You need not keep track of this as you grow
the object, because you can find out the length from the obstack just
before finishing the object with the function <code>obstack_object_size</code>,
declared as follows:
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-obstack_005fobject_005fsize">Function: <em>int</em> <strong>obstack_object_size</strong> <em>(struct obstack *<var>obstack-ptr</var>)</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Preliminary:
| MT-Safe race:obstack-ptr
| AS-Safe 
| AC-Safe 
| See <a href="POSIX-Safety-Concepts.html">POSIX Safety Concepts</a>.
</p>

<p>This function returns the current size of the growing object, in bytes.
Remember to call this function <em>before</em> finishing the object.
After it is finished, <code>obstack_object_size</code> will return zero.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>If you have started growing an object and wish to cancel it, you should
finish it and then free it, like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">obstack_free (obstack_ptr, obstack_finish (obstack_ptr));
</pre></div>

<p>This has no effect if no object was growing.
</p>
<span id="index-shrinking-objects"></span>
<p>You can use <code>obstack_blank</code> with a negative size argument to make
the current object smaller.  Just don&rsquo;t try to shrink it beyond zero
length&mdash;there&rsquo;s no telling what will happen if you do that.
