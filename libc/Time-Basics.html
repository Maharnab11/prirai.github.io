<span id="index-time"></span>

<p>Discussing time in a technical manual can be difficult because the word
&ldquo;time&rdquo; in English refers to lots of different things.  In this manual,
we use a rigorous terminology to avoid confusion, and the only thing we
use the simple word &ldquo;time&rdquo; for is to talk about the abstract concept.
</p>
<p>A <em>calendar time</em> is a point in the time continuum, for example
November 4, 1990, at 18:02.5 UTC.  Sometimes this is called &ldquo;absolute
time&rdquo;.
<span id="index-calendar-time"></span>
</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t speak of a &ldquo;date&rdquo;, because that is inherent in a calendar
time.
<span id="index-date"></span>
</p>
<p>An <em>interval</em> is a contiguous part of the time continuum between two
calendar times, for example the hour between 9:00 and 10:00 on July 4,
1980.
<span id="index-interval"></span>
</p>
<p>An <em>elapsed time</em> is the length of an interval, for example, 35
minutes.  People sometimes sloppily use the word &ldquo;interval&rdquo; to refer
to the elapsed time of some interval.
<span id="index-elapsed-time"></span>
<span id="index-time_002c-elapsed"></span>
</p>
<p>An <em>amount of time</em> is a sum of elapsed times, which need not be of
any specific intervals.  For example, the amount of time it takes to
read a book might be 9 hours, independently of when and in how many
sittings it is read.
</p>
<p>A <em>period</em> is the elapsed time of an interval between two events,
especially when they are part of a sequence of regularly repeating
events.
<span id="index-period-of-time"></span>
</p>
<p>A <em>simple calendar time</em> is a calendar time represented as an
elapsed time since a fixed, implementation-specific calendar time
called the <em>epoch</em>.  This representation is convenient for doing
calculations on calendar times, such as finding the elapsed time
between two calendar times.  Simple calendar times are independent of
time zone; they represent the same instant in time regardless of where
on the globe the computer is.
</p>
<p>POSIX says that simple calendar times do not include leap seconds, but
some (otherwise POSIX-conformant) systems can be configured to include
leap seconds in simple calendar times.
<span id="index-leap-seconds"></span>
<span id="index-seconds_002c-leap"></span>
<span id="index-simple-time"></span>
<span id="index-simple-calendar-time"></span>
<span id="index-calendar-time_002c-simple"></span>
<span id="index-epoch"></span>
</p>
<p>A <em>broken-down time</em> is a calendar time represented by its
components in the Gregorian calendar: year, month, day, hour, minute,
and second.  A broken-down time value is relative to a specific time
zone, and so it is also sometimes called a <em>local time</em>.
Broken-down times are most useful for input and output, as they are
easier for people to understand, but more difficult to calculate with.
<span id="index-broken_002ddown-time"></span>
<span id="index-local-time"></span>
<span id="index-Gregorian-calendar"></span>
<span id="index-calendar_002c-Gregorian"></span>
</p>
<p><em>CPU time</em> measures the amount of time that a single process has
actively used a CPU to perform computations.  It does not include the
time that process has spent waiting for external events.  The system
tracks the CPU time used by each process separately.
<span id="index-CPU-time"></span>
</p>
<p><em>Processor time</em> measures the amount of time <em>any</em> CPU has
been in use by <em>any</em> process.  It is a basic system resource,
since there&rsquo;s a limit to how much can exist in any given interval (the
elapsed time of the interval times the number of CPUs in the computer)
</p>
<p>People often call this CPU time, but we reserve the latter term in
this manual for the definition above.
