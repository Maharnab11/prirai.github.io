<p>The functions described in this section copy or concatenate the
possibly-truncated contents of a string or array to another, and
similarly for wide strings.  They follow the string-copying functions
in their header conventions.  See <a href="Copying-Strings-and-Arrays.html">Copying Strings and Arrays</a>.  The
&lsquo;<samp>str</samp>&rsquo; functions are declared in the header file <samp>string.h</samp>
and the &lsquo;<samp>wc</samp>&rsquo; functions are declared in the file <samp>wchar.h</samp>.

<dd>
<p>Preliminary:
| MT-Safe

| AC-Safe 
| See <a href="POSIX-Safety-Concepts.html">POSIX Safety Concepts</a>.
</p>

<p>This function is similar to <code>strcpy</code> but always copies exactly
<var>size</var> bytes into <var>to</var>.
</p>
<p>If <var>from</var> does not contain a null byte in its first <var>size</var>
bytes, <code>strncpy</code> copies just the first <var>size</var> bytes.  In this
case no null terminator is written into <var>to</var>.
</p>
<p>Otherwise <var>from</var> must be a string with length less than
<var>size</var>.  In this case <code>strncpy</code> copies all of <var>from</var>,
followed by enough null bytes to add up to <var>size</var> bytes in all.
</p>
<p>The behavior of <code>strncpy</code> is undefined if the strings overlap.
</p>
<p>This function was designed for now-rarely-used arrays consisting of
non-null bytes followed by zero or more null bytes.  It needs to set
all <var>size</var> bytes of the destination, even when <var>size</var> is much
greater than the length of <var>from</var>.  As noted below, this function
is generally a poor choice for processing text.

<dt id="index-wcsncpy">Function: <em>wchar_t *</em> <strong>wcsncpy</strong> <em>(wchar_t *restrict <var>wto</var>, const wchar_t *restrict <var>wfrom</var>, size_t <var>size</var>)</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Preliminary:
| MT-Safe 
| AS-Safe 
| AC-Safe 
| See <a href="POSIX-Safety-Concepts.html">POSIX Safety Concepts</a>.
</p>

<p>This function is similar to <code>wcscpy</code> but always copies exactly
<var>size</var> wide characters into <var>wto</var>.
</p>
<p>If <var>wfrom</var> does not contain a null wide character in its first
<var>size</var> wide characters, then <code>wcsncpy</code> copies just the first
<var>size</var> wide characters.  In this case no null terminator is
written into <var>wto</var>.
</p>
<p>Otherwise <var>wfrom</var> must be a wide string with length less than
<var>size</var>.  In this case <code>wcsncpy</code> copies all of <var>wfrom</var>,
followed by enough null wide characters to add up to <var>size</var> wide
characters in all.
</p>
<p>The behavior of <code>wcsncpy</code> is undefined if the strings overlap.
</p>
<p>This function is the wide-character counterpart of <code>strncpy</code> and
suffers from most of the problems that <code>strncpy</code> does.  For
example, as noted below, this function is generally a poor choice for
processing text.

<dd>
<p>Preliminary:
| MT-Safe 
| AS-Unsafe heap
| AC-Unsafe mem
| See <a href="POSIX-Safety-Concepts.html">POSIX Safety Concepts</a>.
</p>

<p>This function is similar to <code>strdup</code> but always copies at most
<var>size</var> bytes into the newly allocated string.
</p>
<p>If the length of <var>s</var> is more than <var>size</var>, then <code>strndup</code>
copies just the first <var>size</var> bytes and adds a closing null byte.
Otherwise all bytes are copied and the string is terminated.
</p>
<p>This function differs from <code>strncpy</code> in that it always terminates
the destination string.
</p>
<p>As noted below, this function is generally a poor choice for
processing text.
</p>
<p><code>strndup</code> is a GNU extension.

<dd>
<p>Preliminary:
| MT-Safe 
| AS-Safe 
| AC-Safe 
| See <a href="POSIX-Safety-Concepts.html">POSIX Safety Concepts</a>.
</p>

<p>This function is similar to <code>strndup</code> but like <code>strdupa</code> it
allocates the new string using <code>alloca</code> see <a href="Variable-Size-Automatic.html">Variable Size Automatic</a>.  The same advantages and limitations of <code>strdupa</code> are
valid for <code>strndupa</code>, too.
</p>
<p>This function is implemented only as a macro, just like <code>strdupa</code>.
Just as <code>strdupa</code> this macro also must not be used inside the
parameter list in a function call.
</p>
<p>As noted below, this function is generally a poor choice for
processing text.
</p>
<p><code>strndupa</code> is only available if GNU CC is used.

<dd>
<p>Preliminary:
| MT-Safe 
| AS-Safe 
| AC-Safe 
| See <a href="POSIX-Safety-Concepts.html">POSIX Safety Concepts</a>.
</p>

<p>This function is similar to <code>stpcpy</code> but copies always exactly
<var>size</var> bytes into <var>to</var>.
</p>
<p>If the length of <var>from</var> is more than <var>size</var>, then <code>stpncpy</code>
copies just the first <var>size</var> bytes and returns a pointer to the
byte directly following the one which was copied last.  Note that in
this case there is no null terminator written into <var>to</var>.
</p>
<p>If the length of <var>from</var> is less than <var>size</var>, then <code>stpncpy</code>
copies all of <var>from</var>, followed by enough null bytes to add up
to <var>size</var> bytes in all.  This behavior is rarely useful, but it
is implemented to be useful in contexts where this behavior of the
<code>strncpy</code> is used.  <code>stpncpy</code> returns a pointer to the
<em>first</em> written null byte.
</p>
<p>This function is not part of ISO or POSIX but was found useful while
developing the GNU C Library itself.
</p>
<p>Its behavior is undefined if the strings overlap.  The function is
declared in <samp>string.h</samp>.
</p>
<p>As noted below, this function is generally a poor choice for
processing text.

<dt id="index-wcpncpy">Function: <em>wchar_t *</em> <strong>wcpncpy</strong> <em>(wchar_t *restrict <var>wto</var>, const wchar_t *restrict <var>wfrom</var>, size_t <var>size</var>)</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Preliminary:
| MT-Safe 
| AS-Safe 
| AC-Safe

</p>

<p>This function is similar to <code>wcpcpy</code> but copies always exactly
<var>wsize</var> wide characters into <var>wto</var>.
</p>
<p>If the length of <var>wfrom</var> is more than <var>size</var>, then
<code>wcpncpy</code> copies just the first <var>size</var> wide characters and
returns a pointer to the wide character directly following the last
non-null wide character which was copied last.  Note that in this case
there is no null terminator written into <var>wto</var>.
</p>
<p>If the length of <var>wfrom</var> is less than <var>size</var>, then <code>wcpncpy</code>
copies all of <var>wfrom</var>, followed by enough null wide characters to add up
to <var>size</var> wide characters in all.  This behavior is rarely useful, but it
is implemented to be useful in contexts where this behavior of the
<code>wcsncpy</code> is used.  <code>wcpncpy</code> returns a pointer to the
<em>first</em> written null wide character.
</p>
<p>This function is not part of ISO or POSIX but was found useful while
developing the GNU C Library itself.
</p>
<p>Its behavior is undefined if the strings overlap.

<dt id="index-strncat">Function: <em>char *</em> <strong>strncat</strong> <em>(char *restrict <var>to</var>, const char *restrict <var>from</var>, size_t <var>size</var>)</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Preliminary:
| MT-Safe 
| AS-Safe 
| AC-Safe 
| See <a href="POSIX-Safety-Concepts.html">POSIX Safety Concepts</a>.
</p>

<p>This function is like <code>strcat</code> except that not more than <var>size</var>
bytes from <var>from</var> are appended to the end of <var>to</var>, and
<var>from</var> need not be null-terminated.  A single null byte is also
always appended to <var>to</var>, so the total
allocated size of <var>to</var> must be at least <code><var>size</var> + 1</code> bytes
longer than its initial length.
</p>
<p>The <code>strncat</code> function could be implemented like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">char *
strncat (char *to, const char *from, size_t size)
{
  size_t len = strlen (to);
  memcpy (to + len, from, strnlen (from, size));
  to[len + strnlen (from, size)] = '\0';
  return to;
}
</pre></div>

<p>The behavior of <code>strncat</code> is undefined if the strings overlap.
</p>
<p>As a companion to <code>strncpy</code>, <code>strncat</code> was designed for
now-rarely-used arrays consisting of non-null bytes followed by zero
or more null bytes.  As noted below, this function is generally a poor
choice for processing text.  Also, this function has significant
performance issues.  See <a href="Concatenating-Strings.html">Concatenating Strings</a>.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-wcsncat">Function: <em>wchar_t *</em> <strong>wcsncat</strong> <em>(wchar_t *restrict <var>wto</var>, const wchar_t *restrict <var>wfrom</var>, size_t <var>size</var>)</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Preliminary:
| MT-Safe 
| AS-Safe 
| AC-Safe 
| See <a href="POSIX-Safety-Concepts.html">POSIX Safety Concepts</a>.
</p>

<p>This function is like <code>wcscat</code> except that not more than <var>size</var>
wide characters from <var>from</var> are appended to the end of <var>to</var>,
and <var>from</var> need not be null-terminated.  A single null wide
character is also always appended to <var>to</var>, so the total allocated
size of <var>to</var> must be at least <code>wcsnlen (<var>wfrom</var>,
<var>size</var>) + 1</code> wide characters longer than its initial length.
</p>
<p>The <code>wcsncat</code> function could be implemented like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">wchar_t *
wcsncat (wchar_t *restrict wto, const wchar_t *restrict wfrom,
         size_t size)
{
  size_t len = wcslen (wto);
  memcpy (wto + len, wfrom, wcsnlen (wfrom, size) * sizeof (wchar_t));
  wto[len + wcsnlen (wfrom, size)] = L'\0';
  return wto;
}
</pre></div>

<p>The behavior of <code>wcsncat</code> is undefined if the strings overlap.
</p>
<p>As noted below, this function is generally a poor choice for
processing text.  Also, this function has significant performance
issues.  See <a href="Concatenating-Strings.html">Concatenating Strings</a>.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>Because these functions can abruptly truncate strings or wide strings,
they are generally poor choices for processing text.  When coping or
concatening multibyte strings, they can truncate within a multibyte
character so that the result is not a valid multibyte string.  When
combining or concatenating multibyte or wide strings, they may
truncate the output after a combining character, resulting in a
corrupted grapheme.  They can cause bugs even when processing
single-byte strings: for example, when calculating an ASCII-only user
name, a truncated name can identify the wrong user.
</p>
<p>Although some buffer overruns can be prevented by manually replacing
calls to copying functions with calls to truncation functions, there
are often easier and safer automatic techniques that cause buffer
overruns to reliably terminate a program, such as GCC&rsquo;s
<samp>-fcheck-pointer-bounds</samp> and <samp>-fsanitize=address</samp>
options.  See <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Debugging-Options.html#Debugging-Options">Options for Debugging Your Program
or GCC</a> in <cite>Using GCC</cite>.  Because truncation functions can mask
application bugs that would otherwise be caught by the automatic
techniques, these functions should be used only when the application&rsquo;s
underlying logic requires truncation.
</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> GNU programs should not truncate strings or wide
strings to fit arbitrary size limits.  See <a href="https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Semantics.html#Semantics">Writing
Robust Programs</a> in <cite>The GNU Coding Standards</cite>.  Instead of
string-truncation functions, it is usually better to use dynamic
memory allocation (see <a href="Unconstrained-Allocation.html">Unconstrained Allocation</a>) and functions
such as <code>strdup</code> or <code>asprintf</code> to construct strings.
