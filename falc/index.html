	“The Fine Arts and Literary Council (FALC) aims at promoting the creative process, whether it be in the form of paintings, oration, literary quizzes, contests or visual arts. In this fast-paced society where college curricula often focus Science and Engineering, and students spend recreational time in front of the television, computer or video games, art education often gets overlooked. However, it is an essential part of a student's development.”

    <blockquote>
     Any great work of art … <span style="color:#ffffff">revives and readapts</span> time and space, and the measure of its success is the extent to which it makes you an <span style="color:#ffffff">inhabitant of that world </span>— the extent to which it invites you in and lets you breathe its strange, special air. 
    <h4>&mdash;Leonard Bernstein<br><em>"What Makes Opera Grand?" Vogue (December 1958)</em></h4>
